I think that you could, I really do!
In fact, an attempt was made to this very end in the recent past, and while it failed, it carries important lessons for us, as potential leaders of the new government.
We study history to inform our future actions, so let us examine the facts of this abortive abortion of the ancien régime and see how we can launch a more _effective_ coup.


## How Not To Do It {#how-not-to-do-it}

Our Undergraduate Student Government consists of a cabinet under the President, the College Council, and various working committees.
The roles of each are outlined in the USG [constitution](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5fb85c1e07c4685cab87c0aa/t/63698f4fb505e404481c3480/1667862352150/USG+Final+Constitution.pdf), which may be amended at the initiation of College Council and the approval of the undergraduate student body.
More specific and less permanent are the USG [bylaws](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5fb85c1e07c4685cab87c0aa/t/67cbb291d198d1660063ba8f/1741402770798/USG+Bylaws+(Updated+March+7%2C+2025).pdf), which may be amended unilaterally by the College Council and largely govern committees and procedure.
The cabinet as a whole is largely responsible for maintaining communication with higher-ups, ensuring that things are running smoothly, and suggesting some sort of strategic vision for the government as a whole.
Notably, the President may exercise a veto that can only be overriden by a two-thirds vote of the College Council.
However, the College Council has direct purview over the budget of approximately two million dollars in RSO and administrative funding, which is by far the most important function of USG as a whole.
It also supervises all committees, which are usually either budgetary, advocatory, or supervisory in function.
The Elections and Rules Committee (E&amp;R) is particularly interesting—it is one of the few that is specified in the constitution rather than the bylaws,
and its importance in organizing the elections of College Council members, cabinet positions, and referenda means that it only has actual influence if it is run improperly.

Committee assignments are by appointment, not election, although elected officials may serve on committees.
Nevin Hall, a current fourth-year, was appointed as E&amp;R chair in 2023 but, over the next few years, obtained appointments to various budgetary committees and cabinet positions.
These include the chairmanship of the Program Coordinating Council and the Committee on Academic Teams (both of which manage RSO funding), as well as a cabinet position as Vice President of Student Organizations.
This meant that, by 2025, one single person was in charge of managing elections, distributing about a million dollars in
{{< sidenote "funding," >}}I don't know if I can disclose the precise numbers but I will update this post when they are officially released.{{< /sidenote >}}
and overseeing all USG committees. That is a lot of power for any official to hold, let alone an unelected one.

How did Hall accumulate so many positions?
If you take his [word](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESwvJLfcdaQ) for it, it is because he was the only person around who was both competent and willing.
By most accounts, he fulfilled his responsibilities in each of his roles, so he just kept getting appointed.
However, there were some [accusations](/ox-hugo/Impeachment_Exhibits.pdf) of bias against him from lower-ranked committee members regarding funding allocations.
I can't really assess the validity of these claims (he denies them), though I have been told by people in student government who
were opposed to him that he did not unduly manipulate funding.
Both accusations also mentioned that Hall would brag shamelessly and repeatedly to committee members about the amount of power that he held.
This is consistent with other accounts from College Council representatives.

A piece of our student government's "vision" that has gone unfulfilled for many years is the establishment of a Judicial Council.
The government only has two functional branches, but a judicial branch is outlined in the constitution.
As it stands, the specifics have not been clarified so it is still unimplemented, which is exactly the sort of weird situation that you would want a Judicial Council for.
Currently, judicial review consists of walking up to the Executive Vice President and
{{< sidenote "asking" >}}This doesn't seem to be very sustainable, but I do have concerns about the bureaucratic overhead that such a body would impose on the enactment of legislation.{{< /sidenote >}}
them what they think a particular law means.
Previously, however, it was the "rules" part of "Elections and Rules".

In March 2024, Hall and a College Council representative [proposed](/ox-hugo/Impeachment_Resolution.pdf) competing Judicial Council resolutions.
The latter would have increased the transparency of such a body and, following apparent intimidation attempts by Hall,
was passed with a series of resolutions to curb E&amp;R's power to strike referenda off the ballot.
Guidelines require that notification of a referendum be sent by E&amp;R to the student body three weeks before the start of voting.
This notification was sent out a few hours late, which isn't an issue from a practical standpoint but does technically invalidate the referendum by the letter of the law.
By now, Hall had stacked E&amp;R with cronies, so he had a member of E&amp;R lodge a complaint with E&amp;R about E&amp;R's error, which E&amp;R decided was grounds for invalidation.
In the meanwhile, the resolution passed with 86% of the vote.
Did Hall tank a popular piece of USG legislation that he didn't like?
We can't say for sure—maybe he lost his competence instead.


## How To Really Not Do It {#how-to-really-not-do-it}

Astonishingly, Hall faced no consequences for this episode, and it took a far more egregious offense for College Council, which _still_ had total power over him, to take action.
Between November 2023 and April 2025, Hall took it upon himself to reform the USG bylaws, which he rightly saw as bloated and inefficient.
He did not have the power to amend the bylaws, or indeed propose changes to
{{< sidenote "them," >}}Any member of the student body can introduce resolutions to a vote, but I'm not clear if bylaw changes (which are resolutions) are included.{{< /sidenote >}}
but he knew various people on the College Council and so was able to have _them_ introduce his modified versions for votes.
The first set of changes, nominally reviewed by three different individuals, is described in the meeting minutes by Hall as "[simplifying] administrative process, [cutting] out a lot of procedure for CC that isn’t used, [and updating] constitutional references."
Here's some of the [other](/ox-hugo/Impeachment_Exhibits.pdf) changes made in the bylaws:

-   E&amp;R members were made unimpeachable by the College Council.
-   E&amp;R was given additional powers over mediating RSO disputes and interpreting the bylaws (making it a pseudo-legal body).
-   The E&amp;R chair was given near-unrestricted power to appoint members to their committee, which enabled Hall to get his friends onboard.

All in all, there were twelve proposed changes buried in the new bylaws that Hall did not cover in his rather brief summary.
Until this school year, _changes to the bylaws did not need to be redlined_, so the representatives voted on a massive chunk of text and a "trust me, bro."
The changes passed unanimously.

Hall has attempted to defend his actions in passing these changes.
He claims that he met the former USG President over the summer, and that they agreed on these precise changes to insulate E&amp;R from a potential victory by a frat ticket.
The President's [account](/ox-hugo/Impeachment_Exhibits.pdf) is that they vaguely discussed giving more interpretive power to E&amp;R but that nothing concrete was decided.
As for sneaking in those changes, Hall only has [this](https://youtu.be/ESwvJLfcdaQ?t=681) to say:
> They always got the full text. It doesn't appear that they ever read them [sic].

Hall pushed another two changes to the bylaws in 2025.
Here are some of the highlights:

-   E&amp;R obtained the power to determine "which legislation is licit," and to impeach any member of USG, thus adopting the totality of the Judicial Council's functions.
-   College Council could not amend E&amp;R's elections code unless they approved the same changes over five _non-consecutive_ quarters.
-   The VPSO was given voting status and the vice-chairmanship of every finance committee.

Hall also attempted to extend his influence over SGFC, the largest funding committee, by having a friend appointed as chair despite them having only a [month](/ox-hugo/Emergency_Meeting_Minutes_5_7_25.pdf) of experience.

In reviewing the April bylaw changes, a representative noticed that interpretation of the bylaws had been shifted to E&amp;R, arousing their suspicion.
Further review uncovered the rest of the smuggled changes, so the following week, he was asked to resign as chair.
Things began to move quickly—The Maroon alleges that by the May 5th meeting, Hall had [revoked](https://chicagomaroon.com/47806/news/spring-usg-election-turnout-near-lowest-on-record/) access to voting turnout
{{< sidenote "data." >}}As well as other "essential documents," per the impeachment proceedings.{{< /sidenote >}}
Two days later, College Council convened an [emergency meeting](/ox-hugo/Emergency_Meeting_Minutes_5_7_25.pdf) to remove him from office before he could convene E&amp;R to nullify the recent election results.
For all that Hall had done to protect himself from impeachment, it seems that he had not reckoned with the fact that College Council could just change the bylaws to render him impeachable once more.
After much hand-waving and navel-gazing, they did
{{< sidenote "so." >}}The meeting appear to have been a bit of a clown show—a bunch of people showed up with snacks and a representative quoted Churchill for literally no reason.{{< /sidenote >}}


## Do Better {#do-better}

Hall was not a very good wannabe autocrat.
For one, he was not very discrete.
Bragging about how you hold USG in the palm of your hand to your bosses is a very good way to get fired.
His method of consolidation, too, was flawed.
It doesn't matter how many changes you make to the bylaws if you can't exercise the power accumulated through those changes.
If Hall had actually tried to pass a biased legal judgement, he would probably have been impeached since his changes would have been caught through the very act of using them.
Seeing that he was booted for making bylaw changes that he didn't need, this seems to have been rather poor planning on his part.
What I find concerning is that, if it weren't for the bylaw changes, his influence over the budgetary committees would have been secure.

A better approach to taking over USG would be to actually get elected.
Turnout in the most recent elections was [12%](https://chicagomaroon.com/47806/news/spring-usg-election-turnout-near-lowest-on-record/), down from a peak of
{{< sidenote "73%" >}}I have no clue why so many people voted that year, and I would be surprised if College Council actually kept records from back then.{{< /sidenote >}}
in 2016.
If you have enough friends in each year of school, you can easily get them elected to College Council.
How do I know this?
In the most recent election cycle, Hall _himself_ was elected as a representative for my year because he was the only person running; the second elected representative was a write-in candidate.
He was barred from taking power under a generous reading of the impeachment resolution, which [impeached him](/ox-hugo/Impeachment_Resolution.pdf) from "any and all positions he holds or is scheduled to hold."
Unless Hall was somehow destined to be elected, it sounds to me like he made it fair and square.
And if he can do it, then if you get some friends to run and get some friends to vote for them, two million dollars in funding will be yours!

Now, the actual utility of controlling USG funding is questionable, which is what I find so funny about this scenario.
Why _would_ you want to be the dictator of the University of Chicago Student Body?
Allocating funds takes work, and if you're making big changes in the budget people will notice.
I expect that the university would step in if enough complaints were made, so while you might end up with some degree of latitude with regard to funnelling money into your favorite
{{< sidenote "club" >}}I guess that a really terrible person could set up shell clubs and use CC to fund them, but this would be really obvious with any substantial sum of money because even the biggest clubs recieve around $15000 a year.{{< /sidenote >}}
it doesn't seem like it's worth having to actually do budgeting.
Maybe Hall just really enjoyed pushing paper.


## We Really Do Have A Problem {#we-really-do-have-a-problem}

Now that the Hall saga is over with, College Council seems to have returned to business as usual, though with the added scrutiny of The Maroon recapping their weekly meetings.
There is an air of ineptitude that hangs over proceedings.
The first fifteen minutes or so will be taken up by people correcting misspellings in the previous meeting minutes.
Most of the participation in a meeting occurs at this stage.
For each subsequent line-item, time is usually given for representatives to familiarize themselves because they likely have not done so on their own time.
Most of the meeting agenda is usually tabled.

By my observation, College Council attracts two types of committed people.
The first are roleplayers, who really want to act like they are in a government and doing government things.
They are pedants, because pedantry is the point, so whatever they do is done very slowly.
I recall that after a funding resolution was given its first reading in a recent meeting, the sponsor had to field multiple questions from representatives who were just pointing out typos rather than saying anything substantive.
The second sort of person who might want to become a representative is one who thinks very highly of themselves, very lowly of the roleplayers, and wants to move fast and break stuff.
This, too, is not the right approach to College Council, with its byzantine customs crafted by decades of bureaucratic dominance.
If you offend the bureaucrats, they will make sure that you never get anything done ever again.
There are also a bunch of disinterested people (as I noted, it is very easy to win a seat even if you're running for shits and giggles), but they do not really factor into the legislative process.
The result is that very little actually gets done in your average College Council meeting.

None of this would really matter if College Council and the committees were doing their single important job of properly funding RSOs, but I have reason to doubt this.
For one, it [appears](/ox-hugo/Minutes_5_19_2025.pdf) as though members of USG did not actually review certain aspects of this year's RSO allocations (specifically the use of an extra $10k that the cabinet hadn't realize that they possessed).
The same meeting shows that they had not communicated new funding guidelines (that only their three most important events would be funded by the committees instead of the top 5) to RSOs.
More recently, the
{{< sidenote "Outdoor Adventures Club" >}}I have numerous friends in their leadership, so here I am biased.{{< /sidenote >}}
saw their funding for Spring Break trips cut to [less than half](/ox-hugo/Minutes_02_02_2026.pdf) of the previous year's, under new guidelines that greatly reduce transportation funding for reasons unknown.
The fact that some clubs exist to organize trips seems to have escaped their notice.
The original SGFC allocation was about $2700, which could have eliminated the possibility of these trips altogether, so they already overrode the cost guide in revising the funding.
Not coincidentally, SGFC had only [$4000](https://chicagomaroon.com/50648/news/college-council-recap-usg-hears-more-rso-funding-appeals-discusses-dwindling-sgfc-budget/) to cover the next month of funding requests by the end of that same week.

This begs the question of where the money is going.
The USG budget has slightly increased from last year, but College Council is hearing far more funding requests than in previous years.
In fact, the phenomenon of tabling agenda items seems to be a recent development because College Council could get to all of them back when there were less appeals.
While some members might [blame](https://chicagomaroon.com/50737/news/college-council-recap-members-contest-rso-funding-guidelines-usg-to-distribute-bike-locks/) newer representatives for the new issues—which is spurious to say the least—changes in funding guidelines seem a more likely culprit.
If everybody's getting cut, though, the money has to be going somewhere, and I don't know where that is.

A single competent person could do a lot, and _has_ done a lot, to make USG work.
Interest is so low that anybody who wanted to do it could do it, but nobody wants to do it.
I certainly don't.
If you want to take matters into your own hands, though, maybe you can make the trains run on time!
