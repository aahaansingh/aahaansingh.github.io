The French Wars of Religion are an interesting period of history.
My AP Euro class (way back when) focused far more on it than any other religious conflict of the era.
I don't think the 30 Years War even got a mention, which seems like a bit of an oversight.
My interest in the period was revived recently so I went down a Wikipedia rabbithole, and found that [many](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_French_War_of_Religion_(1562%E2%80%931563)) [of](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_French_War_of_Religion_in_the_provinces) [the](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1560_Assembly_of_Notables) [articles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1559%E2%80%931562_French_political_crisis) on the subject were incredibly comprehensive.
The one on the 1559-1562 French Political Crisis is about 50,000 words, as are the two articles on the First French War of Religion combined.
That's not quite a book on the
{{< sidenote "subject," >}}It's about a third the length of the book on the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth that I'm currently reading, so 130 pages. Also, I can't find recent statistics but I can be sure that the vast majority of Wikipedia articles are under 8,000 words.{{< /sidenote >}}
but it is much more than one would expect to find on Wikipedia, whether because people don't usually put so much effort into articles or because the point of an encyclopedia is to give brief overviews.
Either way, I was interested enough in the subject to benefit from their length.

As it turns out, all of these articles were written by the same [person](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Sovietblobfish)—you, too, can change the world.
I really admire the singular obsession that they have, to be writing so much on this particular period of this particular nation from this particular angle.
For the amount that they contribute, they don't seem to get much feedback on their or their article's talk pages.
Unfortunately, the articles that they have written are all so long that none of them are rated above a B-class in quality.
That is to be expected, but a topic being as specific as the 1559-1562 French Political Crisis already implies a certain level of detail above that of a general encyclopedic entry.
Why would you be reading about it unless you were interested in the specifics?
If the page is too long to be encyclopedic, then the it shouldn't be in the encyclopedia at all.

The political complexity of the French Wars of Religion, which was really a civil war, is incredible.
Through forty years of conflict, families rose and fell from power, flipped sides like pancakes, killed their kin, and made a huge mess of the country in the process.
Broadly, the crown struggled to hold power against the Huguenots—French Protestants—on one side, and hardline Catholics on the other, over the course of nine wars and three inept reigns.
In between were various unsuccessful compromises, one of which wed the king's sister, Margaret of Valois, to the leader of the Huguenot camp, King Henry of

Political marriages are rarely happy, and Margaret's misfortune was to be split on multiple sides of an intractable issue.

At the time of her marriage, Margaret was already known for her beauty and intelligence, but her allegiance with regards to the power struggles within her family was ambiguous and quickly became untenable.
Her marriage to Navarre was a near-instant failure, as it was in the aftermath of their wedding that thousands of Huguenots were slaughtered in the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre, ending the fragile peace.
Still, she was politically tied to Navarre despite their religious and marital disagreements, and she helped him in escaping confinement in the aftermath of the atrocity.
Further complicating affairs was her decision to ally with her youngest brother, Francis of Anjou, who represented a moderate faction in court.
This placed her in opposition to her _elder brother_, the prince Henry (and future Henry III), who was next in line for the throne and allied with the Catholic
{{< sidenote "League." >}}Which was led by Henry, Duke of Guise.{{< /sidenote >}}
Meanwhile, her mother, the scheming Catherine de' Medici, played all sides to maintain her own position as the power behind the throne.
When the feeble Charles IX died, Henry III's ascension to the throne meant that Margaret was caught between her husband and Francis on one side, and her mother and the king on the other.
Her husband's constant affairs (and susceptibility to the influence of his mistresses) alienated Margaret, and with the untimely death of Francis, she had no allies.
At this juncture, she defected to the Catholic League, which had emerged as a challenger to the crown in its efforts to secure the succession for Guise.
The League's preeminence collapsed, however, after Henry III had Guise murdered, and Margaret was confined in the castle of Usson for nineteen years.
It was here that she wrote her memoirs.

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/usson.jpg" >}}

By virtue of their age and the importance of their author, _The Memoirs of Margaret of Valois_ is both a historical document and a work of literature, a mixture that appeals to me.
I thought that it would be interesting to read the recollections of somebody central to the internal struggles of France at the time, especially since, being in literary form, they would hopefully be readable.
Another point of note is that Margaret's legacy has been [complicated](https://archive.org/details/queenmargot01duma/page/n7/mode/2up) by the political and cultural agendas both of her era and of more recent times, which have painted her as sexually promiscuous and morally lacking.
This was already becoming clear by the time that the memoirs were being
{{< sidenote "written," >}}Though the memoirs themselves were written as a response to a rather flowery chapter in her praise, by her friend Brantôme.{{< /sidenote >}}
with political opponents such as her brother, Henry III, spreading rumours about her proclivities.
Such narratives obscure Margaret's political independence and intellectual prowess, which her memoirs highlight.
I was curious to learn about her version of events.

As a story, the memoirs are compelling, though uneven.
Events like the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre and her wedding get little attention, and talk of her personal
{{< sidenote "relationships" >}}Her promiscuity was exaggerated but she certainly did take lovers. The difference is that her huband was praised for his adultery while she was denounced.{{< /sidenote >}}
beyond her family and her husband is completely absent.
Such omissions are likely intentional and political in nature.
I would not be surprised if the same is true for the memoirs' ending, which is so abrupt that I thought that my version of the text was incomplete.
Margaret's last "letter" (for the memoirs are in epistolary form) ends right before the death of Francis and her defection to the Catholic League, betraying her husband and her brother.
Perhaps such unscrupulous political dealings could not have been depicted in a manner which flattered her.
Alternatively, the events which led to her exile may have been too sharp a break to convey in the same work.

Despite these omissions, the memoirs are engaging.
The stories are more interesting than the sort of flowery romances or overdone war dramas that one would find in historical fiction and are delivered concisely, with a sober sensibility.
It avoids a common flaw in memoirs by being neither sentimental nor ponderous.
Margaret's flight from Flanders upon the resumption of Spanish hostilities, in particular, is an exciting and vividly described episode.
With the Spanish soldiers hot on the heels of her party, which was negotiating on behalf of Francis for political support, she had to rely on her intelligence and the goodwill of the Flemish towns to avoid capture.
More generally, she is able to cultivate an appreciation for her personal and political struggles: her shame at her husband's infidelity, her struggles to win the favor of the king and her mother, her attempts to mediate between the royals and Huguenots.
Her illustrations of the court
{{< sidenote "intrigues" >}}A particularly strange one saw Henry III attempt to create a rift between Francis and Navarre by means of a girl that they were both having an affair with.{{< /sidenote >}}
show how intimately bound together personal and political matters really were.

Memoirs invariably attempt to paint their subject in the best possible light, and Margaret's certainly bends the truth in some respects.
She portrays her political actions as being grounded in moral behavior—her quarrel with the king is due to his terrible advisors (and not him), her alliance with Francis is born of sisterly love, and her marriage is loyal, if troubled.
There may be some truth to this, but the royal family was highly politicized and Margaret acted in her own self-interest in order to ensure her survival.
Her conduct was not spotless.
For example, she plotted with Francis and her husband to exclude her brother Henry from the line of succession while he was away from court, reigning as King of Poland-Lithuania.
The plan was scuttled when Charles died and Henry managed to sneak out of Poland to claim the French throne, but it greatly escalated the tensions between siblings.
Later, her defection to the Catholic League may have been prudent—had she remained at Navarre's court, she would have been disposable and thus endangered—but such a nakedly self-interested move cannot be justified on moral grounds.
In the end, though, her decision paid off.
Though the Catholic League was defeated, her isolation meant that she ceased to be a threat, and so she was able to live independently in exile and form her own illustrious court.

I liked reading the memoirs, and I liked the directions that reading the memoirs took me—towards learning more about Margaret as a historical figure, and into reading further about early modern statecraft.
It's not a long read and I think that it lives up to its historical importance, as the first known memoirs written by a woman.
I'll usually start on five old books to end up reading one, so there's my endorsement.
