I decided a few weeks back, while interning at Tudor, to create a new website.

The initial reason was that circumstances conspired to make me use a command line editor in order to debug something.
In the second semester of my freshman year, I was forced to use Emacs for a week.
No reason was given.
I did not enjoy this task from above because Emacs felt cumbersome and the commands they gave us were stuff like "move your cursor to the next instance of a character" and "select and copy text".
It makes sense to teach basic commands to someone starting out on an editor, but I was never given a reason why I /should/ use Emacs at all.
Emacs is Emacs because of its huge and, most importantly, extensible[^fn:1] library of modes and commands.
Anyways, I still barely know any Emacs and haven't used it for any big projects yet but I have been using Orgmode semi-regularly and have found it quite useful.

I thought that Orgmode would be a good way to start out with Emacs, and ox-hugo a good way to start out with Orgmode.
I also think that personal websites are cool and that everyone should have one because it's probably the most coherent way in which you can present yourself to the world.

So, we'll see how this goes!

[^fn:1]:  I have yet to grasp elisp, or lisp in general, so the only script I've written is one that replaces a key sequence with an em-dash.

*** I

The mayoral primary was heating up when I arrived in New York City on a humid June morning.
By the time I'd reached the apartment, three flights up, I'd absorbed the spirit:
an hour of lugging my bags down, up, and around had made me sweaty, and the twenty minutes I waited for someone to open the door had caused it to crust.
The floor had tracks of New York dirt, the counters were dusted with New York crumbs, and the bathroom had that special New York scent—all for a New York rent.
I really was in New York.

I ventured out to buy groceries with my headphones on, then took them off as they got sticky.
I got bored, put them back on, and walked up to Midtown.
The further north I got, the louder it looked.
With a wrap in my mouth, Union Square seemed to me a feast for the four senses.

There were too many cars in Midtown for me to feel comfortable listening to music, so I had to undress my ears in public.
It was also raining, but that did not stop people in strange Puerto-Rican-themed buggies from honking and cheering and generally being exuberantly drenched.
On a big screen above, a Fox News host was announcing something or the other about tariff negotiations.
Fragments of conversation obscured other fragments to create a mosaic of half-finished phrases:
an Indian couple admonishing their young child (for what?), two friends discussing their most recent trip (where?).
A strange fellow asked me where the nearest subway stop was; I pointed across the street.
Then I took it back.

A couple of days later, I took a different route back from work, down 6^{th} St.
The one I usually took, on 4^{th}, was pretty uninteresting, and I wanted to get a better feel for the East Village.
I had on a shoegaze playlist I'd created the day before because I was tired
@@html:{{< sidenote "then " >}}I come up with new ways to organize my music when I'm too lazy to think.{{< /sidenote >}}@@
and tired now.
There were a couple of plastic crates along the sidewalk ahead, heralding the presence of a record store.
The volume of the crates indicated that I'd bumped into a good one.

A1 Records is dense, even by record store standards.
There are shelves above, shelves below, singles, albums, old worn soundtracks, new shiny box sets, and a bunch of turntables to test them all.
Oblivious as I was with my ears shielded, I was having a difficult time playing the game of human Tetris needed to navigate the narrow aisles.
My ears were sweating again.
When I emerged from my aural isolation, reggae was playing on the speaker.
It was a nicer atmosphere than the one that I'd soundtracked for myself.

I nabbed an old copy of Machine Head for $8, which was cool.
I almost never spend over $15 for a record because I've turned record buying into a game of seeing how cheap I can get while finding a record that I really like.
It feels like beating the house, even though you're still giving them money for something you could find on streaming.
People buy records to show their appreciation for music; why be a cheapskate about it?

A., a friend of mine, came over to visit a couple of weeks later.
He was the one who introduced me to Deep Purple.
Years ago, I repaid him by bullying him out of listening to the 1975.
He regaled me with his knowledge of non-alcoholic beers while we walked to Washington Square Park, until he bought a [[https://www.rubiks.com/products/rubiks-edge][Rubik's "Edge"]] and became engrossed with that.

Near Washington Square Park was a friend of his, J., an NYU student and singular personality whom I'd met a few times in the past.
Irony is our generation's default register of communication, a fact that conversing with him reminds me of.
The three of us had such a conversation on the rooftop of his building, self-referential and reverential to the point of meaninglessness.
J., dressed like some vague notion of a '90s British scenester (or my impression of one), had recently and amicably left his old Strokes-stroking

band for the charted depths of individual songwriterhood.
He was dealing with it just fine, really, and tipsily played us a few chords from atop his bed, which was fab.
I was torn between amusement at the bit and awe at his level of commitment, though in retrospect, I think this was one thing that he /was/ sincere about.
One does not choose to chase ghosts on a whim, as Bill Murray [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tdyU_gW6WE][taught us]].

[[file:images/j.png]]

Later, J. slunk off when we met some of A.'s other friends.
I envied him in that

Said friends were coming from a Tyler the Creator concert.
I have only ever heard his music involuntarily, but he is one of those artists about whom I tell others that I "probably should get into" and never do.
This was a very loud and drunk group of people who had a great time drinking at a loud concert, which they assured me was "hype".
With a couple of beers, they got drunker but less loud, which was nice.
I left for bed a bit more buzzed and well versed in their romantic histories than I would have liked.

N., another NYU student, has a vendetta against Tibet, a really strong one that compares in intensity to mine against the French
@@html:{{< sidenote "nation." >}}For being the snobs who used their mystical accents and culinary magicks to dupe the world into eating blue cheese.{{< /sidenote >}}@@
The reasons why are varied and complex, but they do not extend to Tibetan food, which is why we found ourselves eating momos in Jackson Heights on a pleasant afternoon.
Our plan was to go to the Louis Armstrong Museum afterwards, but it was closed by the time we finished.
Planning and timeliness are not the strengths of college students, who must compensate with thrift—in time and coin.
We walked back to the station through the South Asian part of town, which was a bit like a cross between 
@@html:{{< sidenote "Devon Street" >}}Devon Street was a disappointment for me, coming from the Bay Area, and nothing like what I would envision a "Little India" to be except for the tobacco stains.{{< /sidenote >}}@@
and Hazratganj.
People were out there wearing orange hair dye, so I knew it was hardcore.

With Plan A a bust, we settled for The Met, which N. got me into for free.
The glories of this museum are well documented, but I was particularly fascinated by the instruments that were on display.
I've always thought that the nicer guitar showcases were more for looking than for buying, so there isn't much point in going when The Met has them beat with Keith Richard's and Jimmy Page's own Les Pauls.
I could have gone for one of Uli Jon Roth's sky guitars but I think that he requires their use in his search for the [[https://shop.ujr.info/products/uli-jon-roths-in-search-of-the-alpha-law-preorder][Alpha Law]].
Other highlights included a hunting horn made of china, the oldest surviving piano, and a large wooden slit gong from Vanuatu.
The implements for the making of art are often works of art in and of themselves; they signal an appreciation for the work that they enable.

On the way back to the station, we talked about our plans for the rest of the summer.
I had this idea that I would go to a lot of concerts in New York because there would be lots of concerts in New York, but I hadn't found any good ones yet.
When I went to my first concert (The Cure, in Mountain View) with A., I had a good time, because the music was great and I could now consider myself a Cure fan.
I also quite enjoyed seeing Robert Smith bumbling around the stage in his own detatched way.
However, there is something just beyond the reach of explanation that transmutes concertgoing from the act of existing in a loud venue into an /experience/.
It might be the social cachet that comes with signaling taste, or the all-encompassing totality of noise and people, or the enjoyment from going and discussing it with friends, or some collective delusion.
I haven't quite figured out my reason yet, so I guess I'll keep going until I do, and keep going /if/ I do.

N. told me about a friend whom he went to concerts with.
Her favorite bands were The Velvet Underground and The Sex Pistols.
Over the course of their brief acquaintance, she was mostly interested in drinking and moshing at 
@@html:{{< sidenote "crappy punk shows." >}}Or so I've been told. N. has a low opinion of punk music.{{< /sidenote >}}@@
I think he referred to her as a "performative female" for that reason.
I thought that I wanted to be like that at one stage, since my own experience was so different.
My ascent into music culture was inaugurated by a terrible year in which I listened to five new albums a day.
This experience expanded my brain but it was heavy on my own head—both in terms of my inability to process the fire-hose of sounds I was subjecting myself to and in the way that I had few people who listened to what I liked.
Music was a painfully solitary pursuit for me for a long time, and a revoltingly social one for her.
What does a middle ground look like?

I don't really understand jazz.
I learned some theory a long time ago, back when I played the piano, but it didn't stick and I never cared to learn again when I picked up the guitar.
It's possible to enjoy jazz without understanding the
@@html:{{< sidenote "theory" >}}Though pretty much everybody I know who actually listens to jazz is a musician.{{< /sidenote >}}@@, 
and I do to some extent, but it does feel a bit hollow.
"Wow, that's pretty nice," I think, and never listen again on my own time because while it often is, in fact, pretty nice, I cannot get /inside/ it.
I don't know what any of it means and I don't know what to feel about it, and I cannot bask in its soothing presence either because I am constantly trying and failing to appreciate it as I think I should.

Nevertheless, I had resolved to go to a jazz club in New York, which is why I had slunk out of bed in the afternoon to meet N. at Small's.
Small's Jazz Club is a timeless place; aside from the decades of history and photos of legendary performers that grace its walls, it is so dark that you have no sense of what time of day it is.
They host a jam session on Sundays that you can attend for the price of a mandatory drink, and about half of the people crammed in the club were there to play.
N., once among the performers, was having a great time: each new standard they played already had a page in his mental encyclopedia, and the depth of his meta-knowledge seemed to carry his enjoyment.
Quizbowlers love references, and jazz seems to me like the ultimate referential genre.

I, on the other hand, appreciated the musicianship but felt fatigued more than anything after two hours of jams.
A couple of years ago, I came across an [[https://260mc.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/adorno-on-popular-music.pdf][essay]] by Adorno where he draws a distinction between "popular" (jazz) music and "serious" (classical) music along structural, and ultimately economic, lines.
He says a lot of things, many of which I find rather
@@html:{{< sidenote "strange" >}}Such as when he argues that rhythmic dance music suggests military marches and speaks to an obedient tendency in humans. He also argues that, by virtue of being unmechanical—that is, of being unbreakable into constituent parts while still retaining meaning—"serious" music is capable of a far greater degree of expression than "popular" music.{{< /sidenote >}}@@
, but he makes the interesting point that improvisations in jazz are recieved as embellishments rather than as being core to the performance.
I think the idea is that if a whole chunk of a song is replaceable, it's not particularly important.
I thought this was silly at the time because improvisations self-evidently beget original musical expressions.
With every repetition of the head - solo 1 - solo 2 - solo 3 - head structure in each jam, however, I began to take his point and wondered what I was supposed to take out of the exercise.
It felt like the same thing over and over but with different chords and slightly different styles.
I didn't have N.'s meta-knowledge, and I couldn't understand the nature of N.'s enjoyment to begin with—was he feeling something different with each solo?
Did each jam have some sort of internal coherence, a narrative arc, that I could not observe?
I found more enjoyment asking myself these questions between jams than the jams themselves, but if the jams facilitated my asking, maybe I did enjoy them in my own way.

A couple of weeks later, we went to Terra Blues, a blues club not so far away from Small's.
The resident artist, who performed that night, was the bonafide bluesman SaRon Crenshaw, along with his band.
He had a real presence on stage, singing and playing with a charisma that I had never witnessed in person.
The thing to understand about blues is that most of it is played using the same progression with only minor variations, which sounds like it should be boring, but the directions that it is taken are infinite.
After all, most popular music over the past seventy years has its roots in blues.
Even when I went to a jazz festival the following week, this single band, with their ballads and laments, packed more range and emotion than the entire set of jazz
@@html:{{< sidenote "bands" >}}Except for Dee Dee Bridgewater and Bill Charlap's performance, which was incredibly soulful and seemingly telepathic in chemistry.{{< /sidenote >}}@@
, despite the fact that I could hardly hear a third of what was being sung.
I wonder if, in simplifying their sonic palette, performers of the blues are able to focus more on conveying some emotion or sensation.
I always thought that the goal of music was to make you feel and make you think—though the way that I process music is not quite internally consistent, this is usually how I frame it—but
this contrast makes me wonder what other frameworks for musical enjoyment are out there, and how they motivate the creation of music itself.
It bugs me that, sweeping as Adorno's attempts of turning music into a science are, I am not in a position to fully refute them.

I was told not to go to Williamsburg.
"It's filled with performative leftist hipsters sipping matcha while reading feminist literature,"
@@html:{{< sidenote "they told me" >}}Nobody actually told me this, but it was definitely implied!{{< /sidenote >}}@@,
"don't lose yourself in that Dark Forest of Upscale Development and Intentionally Mussed Beards!"
Well, I would not enter such a place without reason, and that reason was zines.
Quimby's started off in the '90s as a bookstore selling homemade booklets (zines) in the cheap artists' neighborhood of Wicker Park, Chicago, and is now a bookstore selling homemade booklets in the expensive gentrified neighborhood of Wicker Park, Chicago.
I have visited the Chicago location a couple of times and quite like it, so I was excited to learn that there was another location across the river from me in Brooklyn.
[[https://medium.com/the-operating-system/bookstores-we-love-nyc-chicago-quimbys-a8db75c97aca][It turns out]] that Steven, the founder, had moved to New York after a stint abroad and opened up the latter location a couple of years back.

I confess that I am not so different from J. in certain respects.
I rarely feel nostalgia because I am young and haven't moved around a lot, but I find myself chasing after ghosts, too, these being my own perceptions of the culture surrounding popular music.

[[file:images/iguanadon.png]]

This was especially acute for me, growing up in a suburb, because there was no organic musical presence, no local bands or musical events.
Music was what I learned on the piano or what my dad put on in the car, for the most part, and even as I racked up artists on Spotify, there was very little /social/ substance for me to attach myself to.
Correspondingly, my favorite comics, /Scott Pilgrim/ and /Blue Monday/, are stories of friends who sneak out to see their favorite bands play, or get into fights about which genres they hate—in other words, talking music /outside/ of creating music.
You can make music with a tin can and a stick, but it takes another person, or maybe another few people, and a band, or maybe a few, and a venue, or maybe /quite/ a few to really enjoy it, if the comics are to be believed.

The idea of Quimby's appealed to me so much because it is a pathway into this world, where people keep their bands close to themselves, where listening to music is more than hearing pleasing noises.
Zines thrived in the previous century as a way for such people to share their recommendations, document the scene, or just write whatever they 
@@html:{{< sidenote "wanted to." >}}Which is not to say that all, or even most, zines are music related. The music ones are just what initially drew me into them.{{< /sidenote >}}@@
They are, unfortunately, far less popular than their peak (when they were also not very popular), which is why they are hard to find outside of Quimby's.
For being one of the largest zine stores in the world, it is really quite small.

Over the course of a couple of visits, I acquired a dainty collection of interesting zines, including Sydney Salk's [[https://compilationnation.substack.com/][Compilation Nation]].
There are lots of album review zines out there, but I really liked the concept of reviewing compilations, since the don't get a lot of love.
It's also very New York, as [[https://compilationnation.substack.com/p/compilation-nation-mutant-disco][many]] [[https://compilationnation.substack.com/p/compilation-nation-state-of-the-union][of]] [[https://compilationnation.substack.com/p/compilation-nation-today-brooklyn][the]] [[https://compilationnation.substack.com/p/compilation-nation-times-square][comps]] document the local scene (or otherwise have some intrinsic connection to the city).
In fact, as one of the reviews noted, Salk gets many of those records from Record Grouch in Greenpoint, supposedly one of the only places weird enough to carry good compilations.
There was a recommendation I could follow.

I felt very cool taking the L over to Brooklyn.
Here I was, going to a small /Record Store/ at the recommendation of a /Zine/ about /Music Compilations/.
I also felt a bit silly because I was going all the way to Greenpoint to buy plastic discs I didn't need at the behest of a booklet I didn't need because all of the articles were on Substack anyways, in my nice, well-pressed work clothes.
Thankfully, going to a record store is its own justification to other people; nobody's actually going to ask you why you're wasting your money because doing so would make them uncultured.
Also, I'm supporting local businesses and helping to usher in the physical music revolution—what noble causes have the naysayers taken up?

The part of Greenpoint that I ended up in didn't seem very different from the rest of the city, though it was a bit more pleasant.
There are lots of brick stores that look pretty similar, which is why I missed Record Grouch on my first
@@html:{{< sidenote "pass." >}}And also because three people were in the process of setting up a gravity-defying seating arrangement on a motorcycle and I was distracted.{{< /sidenote >}}@@
Upon entering, I found it to be a small store that is not very packed by the standards of its peers, but it is, indeed, quite weird.
A harsh industrial piece was playing on the speaker, at odds with the well-lit space but somehow fitting as I began to flip through records that I did not recognize.
There were lots of metal acts I'd never heard of, experimental acts I'd never heard of, and (shockingly) post-punk acts I'd never heard of.
A girl walked in to ask the owner for a job but got turned away on the grounds that their stock was too esoteric for someone without familiarity with the store to be selling.
I did find some great comps that I'd heard before from Habibi Funk and Analog Africa (two of the best reissuers right now) as well as albums by [[https://little-nemo.bandcamp.com/album/turquoise-fields][Little Nemo]] and [[https://numerogroup.com/products/charlie-megira-and-the-hefker-girl][Charlie Megira]].
After buying the latter, I told the owner that I'd learned about the store from a zine, which elicited a "huh, cool."
I probably thought it was cooler than he did.

Vinyl under my arm, I strolled to Radio Transmitter Park, where I sat on the grass.
I spent a while shuffling between songs on my headphones, then decided that I was wasting my surroundings and took them off.
The skyline was alright, but the park's charms lay elsewhere.
It was in the shallow waves splashing against the rocks, the light cadence of distant footsteps, the strange harmony of half-heard conversations, that I was able to find a quiet place.

In my first year of college humanities, my class was instructed to keep a commonplace book of quotes and comments for each of our assigned readings to get us thinking critically about them.
This had the effect of making the unit more interesting, but also of making the idea of keeping a commonplace book less attractive.
Still, the idea held some appeal to me.

Over the past couple of years, I have been looking for interesting blogs and websites to follow.
Everybody does this whether they're thinking about it or not, though much of the work is done by the algorithms that we are subject to.
I wanted to remove this element, because, in addition to the well-documented risks and harms of passively being fed information, it just doesn't get me anywhere interesting.
It's not very common anymore to bump into something surprising or exciting on one's daily trundles through cyberspace.
Doing so requires a bit more intentionality—leaping through hyperlinks, I suppose.

I feel like there has been a mismatch between the amount that I've read over the summer and what I have to "show" for it.
Generally, when somebody talks about what they've read (or wants to impress on somebody just how much they've read), they will be referring exclusively to books.
The book as a structure seems to carry with it an inherent prestige, which is warranted to a degree because being immersed in an author's universe, whether fictional or some component of the real, requires many words.
It's a similar phenomenon to how [[https://rateyourmusic.com/][RYM]] incentivizes people to listen to whole albums rather than random songs.
This is a good thing, but books are not the exclusive stores of literary or intellectual merit.

My friend Arnav wrote an [[https://arnavharve.substack.com/p/how-effective-is-congress-as-an-institution][piece]] a couple of months back about the effectiveness of Congress with regard to passing impactful laws, and I thought that his analysis was really interesting.
He considers [[https://therevolvingdoorproject.org/a-brief-history-of-matt-yglesias-screwing-workers/][Matt Yglesias]] and Simon Bazelon's "[[https://www.slowboring.com/p/the-rise-and-importance-of-secret][Secret Congress]]" hypothesis that Congress actually is quite effective but that the perception of Congress's gridlock is fuelled by high-profile, partisan failures.
In short, they claim that a lot is done on issues that are not political flashpoints because they have bipartisan support, but that there are disincentives to such advances being publicized.

Arnav had a nice quick-and-dirty approach to testing the hypothesis, which involved feeding bill information into an LLM and getting it to rate bills by importance.
Thus, he found that there were more impactful bills passed than he (and I) would have believed.

*** Why Is That?

I can think of a couple of reasons which may or may not have to do with the "Secret Congress" hypothesis.
I was quite skeptical of it because legislators in the majority party have an incentive to publicize the passing of /any/ legislation, since it makes their governance seem more effective.
There is also the fact that, as Arnav pointed out, there is no real political incentive for politicians to pass legislature if it won't get them re-elected, unless you believe in politicians acting out of the goodness of their hearts.
I suggest some other reasons for these findings:
+ *Interest Groups*: Election chances aren't a direct function of how helpful the legislation that a politician supports is to the general populace, or the world would be a better place.
  I'm quite surprised that this was not brought up by Yglesias as a reason why Congress might want to keep their activities secret from the public; after all, lobbyists will stay informed regardless, and the people perhaps shouldn't be.
+ *Housekeeping*: A lot of the bills that Arnav named were mostly terminating COVID-era spending or renewing existing processes, like the debt limit raise and FAA reauthorization.
  These could be considered important in some sense, but they are more about keeping things functional; it is about the disincentives of obstructionism, not the incentives for bipartisanship.
+ *Different Strokes*: While people like Arnav and I would not have heard much about disaster relief funding, I'm sure that people who were affected (or proximate to those affected) did.
  I suspect that people take disaster relief as a given; when FEMA got cut recently, it was definitely in the news.

In any case, if we take Congress to operate in secrecy, I would think that interest groups would be the biggest reason why.
More than enabling secrecy, they incentivize it in many case so that legislators are not held accountable.
I found [[https://archive.org/details/gilens_and_page_2014_-testing_theories_of_american_politics.doc/page/n5/mode/2up][this]] interesting study that looks at the quantifiable impacts of interest groups against the will of the citizenry, and though there are clear flaws (the analysis is rather rough and it is hard to draw particular conclusions), I think it is uncontroversial to say that interest groups have an outsized impact on the legislative process.

*** Closing Thoughts

I thought this was a pretty cool idea that was thoughtfully

I agree that it would be cool to find some way to track congressional productivity over time, and I would further suggest doing so by legislator.
When people talk about how productive legislators are, they focus on the number of bills rather than the impact of said bills.
While there's more to being a legislator than writing impactful legislation (because enacting change takes many forms), I think that it would be a useful method of evaluation.
I am, however, too lazy to make it happen.
