I’ve talked to a lot of people about where they find new music.
One gets them from talking to fellow musicians.
Another solicits them from friends.
Many are dependent on Spotify’s suggestions to some degree.
None of them actually read musical criticism in judging what to listen to.

Why is that?
More importantly, does it matter?[^fn:1]


## Friction {#friction}

Music has historically been on a trajectory towards greater accesibility.
For a long time, it could only be heard live.
Then, vinyl records brought music to the home, on demand.
The CDs that superseded them were even more portable and durable, and files eliminated the need for a physical medium altogether.

Each stage has diminished the importance of a critic, because _one_ of their main functions is to tell the aspiring listener where they should invest their time and money.
Fundamental to this premise is that it be significantly easier to consume the criticism than the object of the criticism, which is no longer the case.
If you have a tip that something is good, whether from a friend or from the algorithm, you have enough reason to listen already.
You don't need to seek out a whole review of the album, or even a pithy one-liner.
For that matter, with people listening to playlists more often, album reviews are becoming meaningless anyways.

A corresponding dynamic is the fact that anybody can be a critic now.
With frictionless access to music comes the ability to build a sort of taste very quickly, decontextualized as it is.
RateYourMusic has reviewers who have listened to tens of thousands of albums, numbers inconcievable before the present moment.
This decentralization of criticism further lessens the need for career critics.
When a random guy on the internet has listened to more music than you have, it is difficult to hold your opinion above everybody else, which is exactly what a critic is meant to do.


## Pressure {#pressure}

Where does that leave the critic?
One line of argument is that criticism is dead and that the purpose of a critic is to be an unabashed amplifier of whatever's hot.
[Dan Brooks](https://defector.com/culture-needs-more-jerks) believes that, in quantifying listens and listeners, streaming platforms have created an incentive to bend the knee to popular releases.
I find this unconvincing—reviewers don't really need exact streaming data to know what's popular and they never have.
However, he is right in pointing out that new incentives exist for reviewers to rate popular albums highly.
Online fans certainly exert some amount of pull, as the anonymization of the Paste critic who wrote [this scathing review](https://www.pastemagazine.com/music/taylor-swift/taylor-swift-strikes-out-looking-on-the-tortured-poets-department) attests.
[Freddie](https://freddiedeboer.substack.com/p/poptimism-and-type-of-guy-anxiety) [DeBoer](https://freddiedeboer.substack.com/p/what-weve-lost-in-music-criticism) has expended many words arguing that music critics are chasing the popular mood while deriding each other as "rockists" in their race to escape the mob.
Publications need clicks more than ever, incentivising pandering to the audience.

I question, however, the effect of these factors.
After all, that Paste review _exists_.
In fact, it went viral, so it's not like bad reviews don't get
{{< sidenote "clicks." >}}A caveat: publications still need to review popular records for clicks, though rating them badly is on the cards.{{< /sidenote >}}
In my experience, they are a lot more fun to read than good reviews, and have a broader audience, too:
you don't have to have heard an album to delight in the witticisms of a sharp writer deconstructing it.
Plus, people like to be contrarian, and nobody wants to have idiosyncratic taste more than a critic.
Perhaps this is why reviews on [Pitchfork](https://www.cantgetmuchhigher.com/p/how-music-criticism-has-changed), the supposed bastion of critical subservience, are not necessarily getting more positive over time.

It seems to me that the relationship between [reviewers](https://pitchfork.com/features/lists-and-guides/101-things-that-happened-in-2024-ranked-on-the-pitchfork-scale/) [and](https://www.stereogum.com/2325068/premature-evaluation-taylor-swift-the-life-of-a-showgirl/reviews/premature-evaluation/) [the](https://www.nme.com/reviews/album/sabrina-carpenter-mans-best-friend-review-review-3889055) [zeitgeist](https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/chow-lee-sex-drive/), whatever that means, is fraught.
I find that their analysis of what's playing on the radio is usually undercooked, with pseudo-intellectual theory or ill-fitting musical references to season.
However, to focus solely on this domain is to miss the forest for a tree stump.
Immediate reviews are necessarily not fully thought out, and with media consolidation quietly stripping the art from culture, issues of quality are more of a material nature than some shifting of the norms.

I would contend that musical criticism has adapted rather than died.
Streaming has decontextualized and homogenized musical discovery, which the best critics address.
In fact, the best critics have always addressed this.


## Force {#force}

In being spoonfed a song, you learn little about it.
The first time I heard Siouxsie and The Banshees' "Christine", I thought it was pretty catchy but let it pass by me.
In my curiosity, I read about it.
Christine was a real woman with dissociative identity disorder, her mind so
{{< sidenote "fractured" >}}Like a kaleidoscope.{{< /sidenote >}}
that her children were born to—and attached to—different personalities.
The band itself had fractured [rather acrimoniously](https://genius.com/Siouxsie-and-the-banshees-drop-dead-celebration-lyrics) before it was released on the back of a significant change in their sound.
In the context of their previous albums, "Christine"'s eerie swirls of color are themselves frenzied in quality.

Learning all of this took time beyond merely listening to the song and, yes, required me to read reviews.
It also gave me a far deeper appreciation for what the band's intent was, heightening its effect.

I mean, here, to illustrate the importance of contextualization in criticism.
If a critic cannot tell us what to listen to, they can still tell us how we should think about what we listen to, because doing so enriches the experience.
This can come in a variety of forms—one could clarify the circumstances behind the record itself, as above, or present their case for why they liked or disliked the record.
In the latter case, the context is the critic's lense, their opinion on what was conveyed and how.
It is the force that really enables the critic to mold the tastes of their audience.

This, I think, is what is missing from a lot of reviews on major publications, and it makes reading them less interesting and fun.
Reviews feel anonymized, as though anybody could have written them, as though one writer could be replaced with another and the editorial tone would not change.
I want to know what the reviewer _feels_, not just what they think, and why they feel that way, because music is ultimately about emotion.
I would much rather read a [blatantly biased, glowing review](https://uproxx.com/indie/geese-review-getting-killed/) with the color of a critic than an [ostensibly neutral](https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/geese-getting-killed/) one in grayscale.
One makes me actually want to listen to the album in
{{< sidenote "question," >}}I didn't much like it, but I can clearly see why someone would.{{< /sidenote >}}
while the other is dry enough to skim.
These two articles may have different purposes, in that one is a somewhat abstract consideration of the meaning of a band
while the other is a short piece pumped out very quickly to represent "the most trusted voice in music"'s take in a manner designed to avoid controversy,
but only one is useful.
Quality has objective elements, but if all music were evaluated on these alone, every critic would be the same and nothing interesting would be written.
In the search for objectivity, it is easy to erase one's subjectivity, but often this subjectivity is what makes one worth listening to.


## Inertia {#inertia}

The barriers to entry for making music casually have ceased to exist, even as those to making music professionally have increased.
As such, there exists a virtually unlimited amount of hardly-promoted music to listen to
At the same time, however, platforms like Spotify and TikTok tend to promote the same songs over and [over](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Barely_Know_Her).
This means that most people are well ensconced in their streaming bubbles, and those who want to venture out are quickly overwhelmed.
In other words, it is a difficult climate in which to discover new music.

I think that in the past, the critic's goals of rating music and bringing new music to the listener's attention were bound together,
but while anybody can find some audience to voice their opinions to, not everybody has the capacity to summon good music from the boundless depths of creation.
Those that do need to be well-embedded in a scene and listen to a lot of different acts, which takes time.
As [Steven Hyden](https://stevenhyden.substack.com/p/the-real-reason-music-critics-got) points out, criticism has moved past the generalism of people like Robert Christgau and towards this specialization, which is a great thing because it means better
{{< sidenote "context" >}}Take a look at his review of The Cure's Pornography for an example of a profound mismatch between critic and subject. If his stuff ever irritates me, it's his presumption, not my disagreement.{{< /sidenote >}}
in addition to better discovery.

[The Quietus](https://thequietus.com/) is an example of discovery done right.
Nearly everything they review comes from beyond the awareness of their audience and is also exceedingly [strange](https://thequietus.com/quietus-reviews/rum-music/rum-music-for-september-reviewed-by-jennifer-lucy-allan/).
Most of the music that they review does not click with me and is often quite irritating, but the stuff that does click _really_
{{< sidenote "clicks." >}}They are how I found Heartworms, which is an incredible band/person that I genuinely cannot recommend enough.{{< /sidenote >}}
They bring the unexpected and have no objection to interviewing obscure artists or pushing records that are beyond any reasonable person's conception of music, so long as it suits their own tastes.
Do they ever have bad reviews?
No, but there is no reason to review anything that they do not like.

Of course, not even critics can necessarily afford to discover, because the ever-present need to be read is its own inertia.
Jobs in music publications are fast disappearing, and as a consequence, writers must converge towards the center of mass.
Another issue is the huge amount of fluff that many sites put out, enough to make the actual criticism aspect secondary to the output of pop culture miscellanea.
Finding something new on there becomes an excercise in discovery.
Still, most major
{{< sidenote "publications" >}}And I'm not talking Rolling Stone or NME, two publications that have surely seen better days (I have not seen them) but are now reduced to celebrity gossip and K-Pop, which is not music so much as it is a nebulous, all-encompassing cultural phenomenon.{{< /sidenote >}}
dedicate a significant amount of space towards lesser-known or up-and-coming artists.
To say that publications only cover popular artists, however, is to betray a lack of effort.

In this age of grand delusion, the critic should be a guide, whether by imposing their own scheme or by drawing attention to the strange lands outside our own.
They do not mediate the flow of music anymore, if they ever did, but they exist for a reason and should exist for a reason.
It is unfortunate that these reasons conflict.

[^fn:1]: It's a presumptuous question from anyone, let alone somebody who is not a critic, but I've read enough to know what I like.
