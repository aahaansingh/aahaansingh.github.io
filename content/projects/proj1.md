I'm a big cricket fan and a pretty terrible player, so I live out my fandom of cricket by being an armchair quarterback.
As such, cricket is pretty much the ideal proving ground for new skills that I learn.

I've documented some of my cricket projects [here](https://medium.com/@aahaansingh), along with some of my hopefully interesting findings.
My analysis is based on data from [Cricsheet](https://cricsheet.org/), which I process using [this](https://github.com/aahaansingh/CricBase) tool.
