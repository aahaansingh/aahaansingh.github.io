I decided a few weeks back, while interning at Tudor, to create a new website.

The initial reason was that circumstances conspired to make me use a command line editor in order to debug something.
In the second semester of my freshman year, I was forced to use Emacs for a week.
No reason was given.
I did not enjoy this task from above because Emacs felt cumbersome and the commands they gave us were stuff like "move your cursor to the next instance of a character" and "select and copy text".
It makes sense to teach basic commands to someone starting out on an editor, but I was never given a reason why I /should/ use Emacs at all.
Emacs is Emacs because of its huge and, most importantly, extensible[^fn:1] library of modes and commands.
Anyways, I still barely know any Emacs and haven't used it for any big projects yet but I have been using Orgmode semi-regularly and have found it quite useful.

I thought that Orgmode would be a good way to start out with Emacs, and ox-hugo a good way to start out with Orgmode.
I also think that personal websites are cool and that everyone should have one because it's probably the most coherent way in which you can present yourself to the world.

So, we'll see how this goes!

[^fn:1]:  I have yet to grasp elisp, or lisp in general, so the only script I've written is one that replaces a key sequence with an em-dash.

*** I

The mayoral primary was heating up when I arrived in New York City on a humid June morning.
By the time I'd reached the apartment, three flights up, I'd absorbed the spirit:
an hour of lugging my bags down, up, and around had made me sweaty, and the twenty minutes I waited for someone to open the door had caused it to crust.
The floor had tracks of New York dirt, the counters were dusted with New York crumbs, and the bathroom had that special New York scent—all for a New York rent.
I really was in New York.

I ventured out to buy groceries with my headphones on, then took them off as they got sticky.
I got bored, put them back on, and walked up to Midtown.
The further north I got, the louder it looked.
With a wrap in my mouth, Union Square seemed to me a feast for the four senses.

There were too many cars in Midtown for me to feel comfortable listening to music, so I had to undress my ears in public.
It was also raining, but that did not stop people in strange Puerto-Rican-themed buggies from honking and cheering and generally being exuberantly drenched.
On a big screen above, a Fox News host was announcing something or the other about tariff negotiations.
Fragments of conversation obscured other fragments to create a mosaic of half-finished phrases:
an Indian couple admonishing their young child (for what?), two friends discussing their most recent trip (where?).
A strange fellow asked me where the nearest subway stop was; I pointed across the street.
Then I took it back.

A couple of days later, I took a different route back from work, down 6^{th} St.
The one I usually took, on 4^{th}, was pretty uninteresting, and I wanted to get a better feel for the East Village.
I had on a shoegaze playlist I'd created the day before because I was tired
@@html:{{< sidenote "then " >}}I come up with new ways to organize my music when I'm too lazy to think.{{< /sidenote >}}@@
and tired now.
There were a couple of plastic crates along the sidewalk ahead, heralding the presence of a record store.
The volume of the crates indicated that I'd bumped into a good one.

A1 Records is dense, even by record store standards.
There are shelves above, shelves below, singles, albums, old worn soundtracks, new shiny box sets, and a bunch of turntables to test them all.
Oblivious as I was with my ears shielded, I was having a difficult time playing the game of human Tetris needed to navigate the narrow aisles.
My ears were sweating again.
When I emerged from my aural isolation, reggae was playing on the speaker.
It was a nicer atmosphere than the one that I'd soundtracked for myself.

I nabbed an old copy of Machine Head for $8, which was cool.
I almost never spend over $15 for a record because I've turned record buying into a game of seeing how cheap I can get while finding a record that I really like.
It feels like beating the house, even though you're still giving them money for something you could find on streaming.
People buy records to show their appreciation for music; why be a cheapskate about it?

A., a friend of mine, came over to visit a couple of weeks later.
He was the one who introduced me to Deep Purple.
Years ago, I repaid him by bullying him out of listening to the 1975.
He regaled me with his knowledge of non-alcoholic beers while we walked to Washington Square Park, until he bought a [[https://www.rubiks.com/products/rubiks-edge][Rubik's "Edge"]] and became engrossed with that.

Near Washington Square Park was a friend of his, J., an NYU student and singular personality whom I'd met a few times in the past.
Irony is our generation's default register of communication, a fact that conversing with him reminds me of.
The three of us had such a conversation on the rooftop of his building, self-referential and reverential to the point of meaninglessness.
J., dressed like some vague notion of a '90s British scenester (or my impression of one), had recently and amicably left his old Strokes-stroking
@@html:{{< sidenote "band" >}}I have recently been informed that they are recording an album, though I unfortunately do not know if J. is part of this process.{{< /sidenote >}}@@
for the charted depths of individual songwriterhood.
He was dealing with it just fine, really, and tipsily played us a few chords from atop his bed, which was fab.
I was torn between amusement at the bit and awe at his level of commitment, though in retrospect, I think this was one thing that he /was/ sincere about.
One does not choose to chase ghosts on a whim, as Bill Murray [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tdyU_gW6WE][taught us]].

[[file:images/j.png]]

Later, J. slunk off when we met some of A.'s other friends.
I envied him in that

Said friends were coming from a Tyler the Creator concert.
I have only ever heard his music involuntarily, but he is one of those artists about whom I tell others that I "probably should get into" and never do.
This was a very loud and drunk group of people who had a great time drinking at a loud concert, which they assured me was "hype".
With a couple of beers, they got drunker but less loud, which was nice.
I left for bed a bit more buzzed and well versed in their romantic histories than I would have liked.

N., another NYU student, has a vendetta against Tibet, a really strong one that compares in intensity to mine against the French

The reasons why are varied and complex, but they do not extend to Tibetan food, which is why we found ourselves eating momos in Jackson Heights on a pleasant afternoon.
Our plan was to go to the Louis Armstrong Museum afterwards, but it was closed by the time we finished.
Planning and timeliness are not the strengths of college students, who must compensate with thrift—in time and coin.
We walked back to the station through the South Asian part of town, which was a bit like a cross between 
@@html:{{< sidenote "Devon Street" >}}Devon Street was a disappointment for me, coming from the Bay Area, and nothing like what I would envision a "Little India" to be except for the tobacco stains.{{< /sidenote >}}@@
and Hazratganj.
People were out there wearing orange hair dye, so I knew it was hardcore.

With Plan A a bust, we settled for The Met, which N. got me into for free.
The glories of this museum are well documented, but I was particularly fascinated by the instruments that were on display.
I've always thought that the nicer guitar showcases were more for looking than for buying, so there isn't much point in going when The Met has them beat with Keith Richard's and Jimmy Page's own Les Pauls.
I could have gone for one of Uli Jon Roth's sky guitars but I think that he requires their use in his search for the [[https://shop.ujr.info/products/uli-jon-roths-in-search-of-the-alpha-law-preorder][Alpha Law]].
Other highlights included a hunting horn made of china, the oldest surviving piano, and a large wooden slit gong from Vanuatu.
The implements for the making of art are often works of art in and of themselves; they signal an appreciation for the work that they enable.

On the way back to the station, we talked about our plans for the rest of the summer.
I had this idea that I would go to a lot of concerts in New York because there would be lots of concerts in New York, but I hadn't found any good ones yet.
When I went to my first concert (The Cure, in Mountain View) with A., I had a good time, because the music was great and I could now consider myself a Cure fan.
I also quite enjoyed seeing Robert Smith bumbling around the stage in his own detatched way.
However, there is something just beyond the reach of explanation that transmutes concertgoing from the act of existing in a loud venue into an /experience/.
It might be the social cachet that comes with signaling taste, or the all-encompassing totality of noise and people, or the enjoyment from going and discussing it with friends, or some collective delusion.
I haven't quite figured out my reason yet, so I guess I'll keep going until I do, and keep going /if/ I do.

N. told me about a friend whom he went to concerts with.
Her favorite bands were The Velvet Underground and The Sex Pistols.
Over the course of their brief acquaintance, she was mostly interested in drinking and moshing at 
@@html:{{< sidenote "crappy punk shows." >}}Or so I've been told. N. has a low opinion of punk music.{{< /sidenote >}}@@
I think he referred to her as a "performative female" for that reason.
I thought that I wanted to be like that at one stage, since my own experience was so different.
My ascent into music culture was inaugurated by a terrible year in which I listened to five new albums a day.
This experience expanded my brain but it was heavy on my own head—both in terms of my inability to process the fire-hose of sounds I was subjecting myself to and in the way that I had few people who listened to what I liked.
Music was a painfully solitary pursuit for me for a long time, and a revoltingly social one for her.
What does a middle ground look like?

*** IV

I don't really understand jazz.
I learned some theory a long time ago, back when I played the piano, but it didn't stick and I never cared to learn again when I picked up the guitar.
It's possible to enjoy jazz without understanding the
@@html:{{< sidenote "theory" >}}Though pretty much everybody I know who actually listens to jazz is a musician.{{< /sidenote >}}@@, 
and I do to some extent, but it does feel a bit hollow.
"Wow, that's pretty nice," I think, and never listen again on my own time because while it often is, in fact, pretty nice, I cannot get /inside/ it.
I don't know what any of it means and I don't know what to feel about it, and I cannot bask in its soothing presence either because I am constantly trying and failing to appreciate it as I think I should.

Nevertheless, I had resolved to go to a jazz club in New York, which is why I had slunk out of bed in the afternoon to meet N. at Small's.
Small's Jazz Club is a timeless place; aside from the decades of history and photos of legendary performers that grace its walls, it is so dark that you have no sense of what time of day it is.
They host a jam session on Sundays that you can attend for the price of a mandatory drink, and about half of the people crammed in the club were there to play.
N., once among the performers, was having a great time: each new standard they played already had a page in his mental encyclopedia, and the depth of his meta-knowledge seemed to carry his enjoyment.
Quizbowlers love references, and jazz seems to me like the ultimate referential genre.

I, on the other hand, appreciated the musicianship but felt fatigued more than anything after two hours of jams.
A couple of years ago, I came across an [[https://260mc.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/adorno-on-popular-music.pdf][essay]] by Adorno where he draws a distinction between "popular" (jazz) music and "serious" (classical) music along structural, and ultimately economic, lines.
He says a lot of things, many of which I find rather
@@html:{{< sidenote "strange" >}}Such as when he argues that rhythmic dance music suggests military marches and speaks to an obedient tendency in humans. He also argues that, by virtue of being unmechanical—that is, of being unbreakable into constituent parts while still retaining meaning—"serious" music is capable of a far greater degree of expression than "popular" music.{{< /sidenote >}}@@
, but he makes the interesting point that improvisations in jazz are recieved as embellishments rather than as being core to the performance.
I think the idea is that if a whole chunk of a song is replaceable, it's not particularly important.
I thought this was silly at the time because improvisations self-evidently beget original musical expressions.
With every repetition of the head - solo 1 - solo 2 - solo 3 - head structure in each jam, however, I began to take his point and wondered what I was supposed to take out of the exercise.
It felt like the same thing over and over but with different chords and slightly different styles.
I didn't have N.'s meta-knowledge, and I couldn't understand the nature of N.'s enjoyment to begin with—was he feeling something different with each solo?
Did each jam have some sort of internal coherence, a narrative arc, that I could not observe?
I found more enjoyment asking myself these questions between jams than the jams themselves, but if the jams facilitated my asking, maybe I did enjoy them in my own way.

A couple of weeks later, we went to Terra Blues, a blues club not so far away from Small's.
The resident artist, who performed that night, was the bonafide bluesman SaRon Crenshaw, along with his band.
He had a real presence on stage, singing and playing with a charisma that I had never witnessed in person.
The thing to understand about blues is that most of it is played using the same progression with only minor variations, which sounds like it should be boring, but the directions that it is taken are infinite.
After all, most popular music over the past seventy years has its roots in blues.
Even when I went to a jazz festival the following week, this single band, with their ballads and laments, packed more range and emotion than the entire set of jazz
@@html:{{< sidenote "bands" >}}Except for Dee Dee Bridgewater and Bill Charlap's performance, which was incredibly soulful and seemingly telepathic in chemistry.{{< /sidenote >}}@@
, despite the fact that I could hardly hear a third of what was being sung.
I wonder if, in simplifying their sonic palette, performers of the blues are able to focus more on conveying some emotion or sensation.
I always thought that the goal of music was to make you feel and make you think—though the way that I process music is not quite internally consistent, this is usually how I frame it—but
this contrast makes me wonder what other frameworks for musical enjoyment are out there, and how they motivate the creation of music itself.
It bugs me that, sweeping as Adorno's attempts of turning music into a science are, I am not in a position to fully refute them.

I was told not to go to Williamsburg.
"It's filled with performative leftist hipsters sipping matcha while reading feminist literature,"
@@html:{{< sidenote "they told me" >}}Nobody actually told me this, but it was definitely implied!{{< /sidenote >}}@@,
"don't lose yourself in that Dark Forest of Upscale Development and Intentionally Mussed Beards!"
Well, I would not enter such a place without reason, and that reason was zines.
Quimby's started off in the '90s as a bookstore selling homemade booklets (zines) in the cheap artists' neighborhood of Wicker Park, Chicago, and is now a bookstore selling homemade booklets in the expensive gentrified neighborhood of Wicker Park, Chicago.
I have visited the Chicago location a couple of times and quite like it, so I was excited to learn that there was another location across the river from me in Brooklyn.
[[https://medium.com/the-operating-system/bookstores-we-love-nyc-chicago-quimbys-a8db75c97aca][It turns out]] that Steven, the founder, had moved to New York after a stint abroad and opened up the latter location a couple of years back.

I confess that I am not so different from J. in certain respects.
I rarely feel nostalgia because I am young and haven't moved around a lot, but I find myself chasing after ghosts, too, these being my own perceptions of the culture surrounding popular music.

[[file:images/iguanadon.png]]

This was especially acute for me, growing up in a suburb, because there was no organic musical presence, no local bands or musical events.
Music was what I learned on the piano or what my dad put on in the car, for the most part, and even as I racked up artists on Spotify, there was very little /social/ substance for me to attach myself to.
Correspondingly, my favorite comics, /Scott Pilgrim/ and /Blue Monday/, are stories of friends who sneak out to see their favorite bands play, or get into fights about which genres they hate—in other words, talking music /outside/ of creating music.
You can make music with a tin can and a stick, but it takes another person, or maybe another few people, and a band, or maybe a few, and a venue, or maybe /quite/ a few to really enjoy it, if the comics are to be believed.

The idea of Quimby's appealed to me so much because it is a pathway into this world, where people keep their bands close to themselves, where listening to music is more than hearing pleasing noises.
Zines thrived in the previous century as a way for such people to share their recommendations, document the scene, or just write whatever they 
@@html:{{< sidenote "wanted to." >}}Which is not to say that all, or even most, zines are music related. The music ones are just what initially drew me into them.{{< /sidenote >}}@@
They are, unfortunately, far less popular than their peak (when they were also not very popular), which is why they are hard to find outside of Quimby's.
For being one of the largest zine stores in the world, it is really quite small.

Over the course of a couple of visits, I acquired a dainty collection of interesting zines, including Sydney Salk's [[https://compilationnation.substack.com/][Compilation Nation]].
There are lots of album review zines out there, but I really liked the concept of reviewing compilations, since they don't get a lot of love.
It's also very New York, as [[https://compilationnation.substack.com/p/compilation-nation-mutant-disco][many]] [[https://compilationnation.substack.com/p/compilation-nation-state-of-the-union][of]] [[https://compilationnation.substack.com/p/compilation-nation-today-brooklyn][the]] [[https://compilationnation.substack.com/p/compilation-nation-times-square][comps]] document the local scene (or otherwise have some intrinsic connection to the city).
In fact, as one of the reviews noted, Salk gets many of those records from Record Grouch in Greenpoint, supposedly one of the only places weird enough to carry good compilations.
There was a recommendation I could follow.

I felt very cool taking the L over to Brooklyn.
Here I was, going to a small /Record Store/ at the recommendation of a /Zine/ about /Music Compilations/.
I also felt a bit silly because I was going all the way to Greenpoint to buy plastic discs I didn't need at the behest of a booklet I didn't need because all of the articles were on Substack anyways, in my nice, well-pressed work clothes.
Thankfully, going to a record store is its own justification to other people; nobody's actually going to ask you why you're wasting your money because doing so would make them uncultured.
Also, I'm supporting local businesses and helping to usher in the physical music revolution—what noble causes have the naysayers taken up?

The part of Greenpoint that I ended up in didn't seem very different from the rest of the city, though it was a bit more pleasant.
There are lots of brick stores that look pretty similar, which is why I missed Record Grouch on my first
@@html:{{< sidenote "pass." >}}And also because three people were in the process of setting up a gravity-defying seating arrangement on a motorcycle and I was distracted.{{< /sidenote >}}@@
Upon entering, I found it to be a small store that is not very packed by the standards of its peers, but it is, indeed, quite weird.
A harsh industrial piece was playing on the speaker, at odds with the well-lit space but somehow fitting as I began to flip through records that I did not recognize.
There were lots of metal acts I'd never heard of, experimental acts I'd never heard of, and (shockingly) post-punk acts I'd never heard of.
A girl walked in to ask the owner for a job but got turned away on the grounds that their stock was too esoteric for someone without familiarity with the store to be selling.
I did find some great comps that I'd heard before from Habibi Funk and Analog Africa (two of the best reissuers right now) as well as albums by [[https://little-nemo.bandcamp.com/album/turquoise-fields][Little Nemo]] and [[https://numerogroup.com/products/charlie-megira-and-the-hefker-girl][Charlie Megira]].
After buying the latter, I told the owner that I'd learned about the store from a zine, which elicited a "huh, cool."
I probably thought it was cooler than he did.

Vinyl under my arm, I strolled to Radio Transmitter Park, where I sat on the grass.
I spent a while shuffling between songs on my headphones, then decided that I was wasting my surroundings and took them off.
The skyline was alright, but the park's charms lay elsewhere.
It was in the shallow waves splashing against the rocks, the light cadence of distant footsteps, the strange harmony of half-heard conversations, that I was able to find a quiet place.
** DONE What Are Music Critics For?
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: post3
:EXPORT_DATE: 2025-10-05
:END:

I’ve talked to a lot of people about where they find new music.
One gets them from talking to fellow musicians.
Another solicits them from friends.
Many are dependent on Spotify’s suggestions to some degree.
None of them actually read musical criticism in judging what to listen to.

Why is that?
More importantly, does it matter?

*** Friction
Music has historically been on a trajectory towards greater accesibility.
For a long time, it could only be heard live.
Then, vinyl records brought music to the home, on demand.
The CDs that superseded them were even more portable and durable, and files eliminated the need for a physical medium altogether.

Each stage has diminished the importance of a critic, because /one/ of their main functions is to tell the aspiring listener where they should invest their time and money.
Fundamental to this premise is that it be significantly easier to consume the criticism than the object of the criticism, which is no longer the case.
If you have a tip that something is good, whether from a friend or from the algorithm, you have enough reason to listen already.
You don't need to seek out a whole review of the album, or even a pithy one-liner.
For that matter, with people listening to playlists more often, album reviews are becoming meaningless anyways.

A corresponding dynamic is the fact that anybody can be a critic now.
With frictionless access to music comes the ability to build a sort of taste very quickly, decontextualized as it is.
RateYourMusic has reviewers who have listened to tens of thousands of albums, numbers inconcievable before the present moment.
This decentralization of criticism further lessens the need for career critics.
When a random guy on the internet has listened to more music than you have, it is difficult to hold your opinion above everybody else, which is exactly what a critic is meant to do.

*** Pressure
Where does that leave the critic?
One line of argument is that criticism is dead and that the purpose of a critic is to be an unabashed amplifier of whatever's hot.
[[https://defector.com/culture-needs-more-jerks][Dan Brooks]] believes that, in quantifying listens and listeners, streaming platforms have created an incentive to bend the knee to popular releases.
I find this unconvincing—reviewers don't really need exact streaming data to know what's popular and they never have.
However, he is right in pointing out that new incentives exist for reviewers to rate popular albums highly.
Online fans certainly exert some amount of pull, as the anonymization of the Paste critic who wrote [[https://www.pastemagazine.com/music/taylor-swift/taylor-swift-strikes-out-looking-on-the-tortured-poets-department][this scathing review]] attests.
[[https://freddiedeboer.substack.com/p/poptimism-and-type-of-guy-anxiety][Freddie]] [[https://freddiedeboer.substack.com/p/what-weve-lost-in-music-criticism][DeBoer]] has expended many words arguing that music critics are chasing the popular mood while deriding each other as "rockists" in their race to escape the mob.
Publications need clicks more than ever, incentivising pandering to the audience.

I question, however, the effect of these factors.
After all, that Paste review /exists/.
In fact, it went viral, so it's not like bad reviews don't get clicks.
In my experience, they are a lot more fun to read than good reviews, and have a broader audience, too:
you don't have to have heard an album to delight in the witticisms of a sharp writer deconstructing it.
Plus, people like to be contrarian, and nobody wants to have idiosyncratic taste more than someone whose job it is to write interesting things about art.
Perhaps this is why reviews on [[https://www.cantgetmuchhigher.com/p/how-music-criticism-has-changed][Pitchfork]], the supposed bastion of critical subservience, are not necessarily getting more positive over time.

It seems to me that the relationship between [[https://pitchfork.com/features/lists-and-guides/101-things-that-happened-in-2024-ranked-on-the-pitchfork-scale/][reviewers]] [[https://www.stereogum.com/2325068/premature-evaluation-taylor-swift-the-life-of-a-showgirl/reviews/premature-evaluation/][and]] [[https://www.nme.com/reviews/album/sabrina-carpenter-mans-best-friend-review-review-3889055][the]] [[https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/chow-lee-sex-drive/][zeitgeist]], whatever that means, is fraught.
I find that their analysis of what's playing on the radio is usually undercooked, with pseudo-intellectual theory or ill-fitting musical references to season.
However, to focus solely on this domain is to miss the forest for a tree stump.
Immediate reviews are necessarily not fully thought out, and with media consolidation quietly stripping the art from culture, issues of quality are more of a material nature than some shifting of the norms.

I would contend that musical criticism has adapted rather than died.
Streaming has decontextualized and homogenized musical discovery, which the best critics address.
In fact, the best critics have always addressed this.

*** Force
In being spoonfed a song, you learn little about it.
The first time I heard Siouxsie and The Banshees' "Christine", I thought it was pretty catchy, but I didn't think about it much until I randomly got curious about the lyrics.
Christine, the subject, was a real woman with dissociative identity disorder, her mind so
@@html:{{< sidenote "fractured" >}}Like a kaleidoscope.{{< /sidenote >}}@@
that her children were born to—and attached to—different personalities.
The band itself had fractured [[https://genius.com/Siouxsie-and-the-banshees-drop-dead-celebration-lyrics][rather acrimoniously]] before it was released on the back of a significant change in their sound.
In the context of their previous albums, "Christine"'s eerie swirls of color are themselves frenzied in quality.

Learning all of this took time beyond merely listening to the song and, yes, required me to read reviews.
It also gave me a far deeper appreciation for what the band's intent was, heightening its effect.

I mean, here, to illustrate the importance of contextualization in criticism.
If a critic cannot tell us what to listen to, they can still tell us how we should think about what we listen to, because doing so enriches the experience.
This can come in a variety of forms—one could clarify the circumstances behind the record itself, as above, or present their case for why they liked or disliked the record.
In the latter case, the context is the critic's lense, their opinion on what was conveyed and how.
It is the force that really enables the critic to mold the tastes of their audience.

This, I think, is what is missing from a lot of reviews on major publications, and it makes reading them less interesting and fun.
Reviews feel anonymized, as though anybody could have written them, as though one writer could be replaced with another and the editorial tone would not change.
I want to know what the reviewer /feels/, not just what they think, and why they feel that way, because music is ultimately about emotion.
I would much rather read a [[https://uproxx.com/indie/geese-review-getting-killed/][blatantly biased, glowing review]] with the color of a critic than an [[https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/geese-getting-killed/][ostensibly neutral]] one in grayscale.
One makes me actually want to listen to the album in
@@html:{{< sidenote "question," >}}I didn't much like it, but I can clearly see why someone would.{{< /sidenote >}}@@
while the other is dry enough to skim and ultimately ignore.
These two articles may have different purposes, in that one is a somewhat abstract consideration of the meaning of a band
while the other is a short piece pumped out very quickly to represent "the most trusted voice in music"'s take in a manner designed to avoid controversy,
but only one is useful.
Quality has objective elements, but if all music were evaluated on these alone, every critic would be the same and nothing interesting would be written.
More importantly, a lot of what actually makes music worth listening to would be lost.
In the search for objectivity, it is easy to erase one's subjectivity, but often this subjectivity is what makes one worth listening to.

*** Inertia
The barriers to entry for making music casually have ceased to exist, even as those to making music professionally have increased.
As such, there exists a virtually unlimited amount of hardly-promoted music to listen to.
At the same time, however, platforms like Spotify and TikTok tend to promote the same songs over and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Barely_Know_Her][over]].
This means that most people are well ensconced in their streaming bubbles, and those who want to venture out are quickly overwhelmed.
In other words, it is a difficult climate in which to discover new music.

I think that in the past, the critic's goals of rating music and bringing new music to the listener's attention were bound together,
but while anybody can find some audience to voice their opinions to, not everybody has the capacity to summon good music from the boundless depths of creation.
Those that do need to be well-embedded in a scene and listen to a lot of different acts, which takes time.
As [[https://stevenhyden.substack.com/p/the-real-reason-music-critics-got][Steven Hyden]] points out, criticism has moved past the generalism of people like Robert Christgau and towards this specialization, which is a great thing because it means better

in addition to better discovery.
The decline of the smug reviewer may have more to do with the fact that smugness disguises ignorance than any trend towards political correctness.

[[https://thequietus.com/][The Quietus]] is an example of discovery done right.
Nearly everything they review comes from beyond the awareness of their audience and is also exceedingly [[https://thequietus.com/quietus-reviews/rum-music/rum-music-for-september-reviewed-by-jennifer-lucy-allan/][strange]].
Most of the music that they review does not click with me and is often quite irritating, but the stuff that does click /really/
@@html:{{< sidenote "clicks." >}}They are how I found Heartworms, which is an incredible band/person that I genuinely cannot recommend enough.{{< /sidenote >}}@@
They bring the unexpected and have no objection to interviewing obscure artists or pushing records that are beyond most people's conception of music, so long as it suits their own tastes.
Do they ever have bad reviews?
No, but there is no reason to review anything that they do not like.

Of course, not even critics can necessarily afford to discover, because the ever-present need to be read is its own inertia.
Jobs in music publications are fast disappearing, and as a consequence, writers must converge towards the center of mass.
Another issue is the huge amount of fluff that many sites put out, enough to make the actual criticism aspect secondary to the output of pop culture miscellanea.
Finding something new on there becomes an excercise in discovery.
Still, most major
@@html:{{< sidenote "publications" >}}And I'm not talking Rolling Stone or NME, two publications that have surely seen better days (I have not seen them) but are now reduced to celebrity gossip and K-Pop, which is not music so much as it is a nebulous, all-encompassing cultural phenomenon.{{< /sidenote >}}@@
dedicate a significant amount of space towards lesser-known or up-and-coming artists.
To say that publications only cover popular artists, however, is to betray a lack of effort.
If you're actually looking for new music that suits your taste, you can probably find it.

What are critics for?
It's a presumptuous question from anyone, let alone somebody who is not a critic, but I've read enough to know what I like.
For me, good criticism guides the reader, whether by evaluating the music by a clear framework, providing context, or directing the reader beyond the limits of their experience.
Critics do not mediate the flow of music anymore, if they ever did, but they still exist for a reason and should exist for a reason.
It is unfortunate that these reasons conflict.

In my first year of college humanities, my class was instructed to keep a commonplace book of quotes and comments for each of our assigned readings to get us thinking critically about them.
This had the effect of making the unit more interesting, but also of making the idea of keeping a commonplace book less attractive.
Still, the idea held some appeal to me.

Over the past couple of years, I have been looking for interesting blogs and websites to follow.
Everybody does this whether they're thinking about it or not, though much of the work is done by the algorithms that we are subject to.
I wanted to remove this element, because, in addition to the well-documented risks and harms of passively being fed information, it just doesn't get me anywhere interesting.
It's not very common anymore to bump into something surprising or exciting on one's daily trundles through cyberspace.
Doing so requires a bit more intentionality—leaping through hyperlinks, I suppose.

In any case, here are some interesting websites, in no particular order.

*** Tech

- [[https://www.citationneeded.news//][Citation Needed]]: I did not find crypto very interesting before this newsletter, but now I do!
  Molly White is very methodical in how she dissects the complex, tangled interests of the crypto industry, which is very important now that crypto is going mainstream.
  
- [[https://www.wheresyoured.at/][Where's Your Ed At]]: I found Ed Zitron's Substack a few months back. He has very interesting things to stay about the present state and trajectory of private-sector AI;
  over the past few months, he has been looking more and more correct.

*** Music

- [[https://thequietus.com/][The Quietus]]: I don't listen to what they push 90% of the time since they're a bit experimental for my tastes but the 10% is a very good 10%.

- [[https://compilationnation.substack.com/][Compilation Nation]]: I picked up an older Compilation Nation zine and it was very good, and this is the same thing but online.

*** Misc
- [[https://kottke.org/][Kottke]]: I don't read most of the posts on here but every so often they post something /really/ interesting and that's often how I discover a new blog.

- [[https://pudding.cool/][The Pudding]]: I don't think journalism gets much more engaging than [[https://pudding.cool/2025/04/music-dna][this]].

I feel like there has been a mismatch between the amount that I've read over the summer and what I have to "show" for it.
Generally, when somebody talks about what they've read (or wants to impress on somebody just how much they've read), they will be referring exclusively to books.
The book as a structure seems to carry with it an inherent prestige, which is warranted to a degree because being immersed in an author's universe, whether fictional or some component of the real, requires many words.
It's a similar phenomenon to how [[https://rateyourmusic.com/][RYM]] incentivizes people to listen to whole albums rather than random songs.
This is a good thing, but books are not the exclusive stores of literary or intellectual merit.

I have not read many books this
@@html:{{< sidenote "summer" >}}Though I am very proud of the fact that I completed Anna Karenina after nine months.{{< /sidenote >}}@@
for various reasons, one of which is the fact that I have spent much of my reading time looking for blogs and interesting publications to follow.
I feel like this has been time well spent because one should read widely to some degree in addition to reading deeply, and building a good (RSS) feed enables the former.
Over the course of this search, I have found pieces that have made me think very much.
To give the articles that I find interesting due consideration, I think that it would be a good exercise to clarify my thoughts on one such article, every so often, and share

My friend Arnav wrote an [[https://arnavharve.substack.com/p/how-effective-is-congress-as-an-institution][piece]] a couple of months back about the effectiveness of Congress with regard to passing impactful laws, and I thought that his analysis was really interesting.
He considers [[https://therevolvingdoorproject.org/a-brief-history-of-matt-yglesias-screwing-workers/][Matt Yglesias]] and Simon Bazelon's "[[https://www.slowboring.com/p/the-rise-and-importance-of-secret][Secret Congress]]" hypothesis that Congress actually is quite effective but that the perception of Congress's gridlock is fuelled by high-profile, partisan failures.
In short, they claim that a lot is done on issues that are not political flashpoints because they have bipartisan support, but that there are disincentives to such advances being publicized.

Arnav had a nice quick-and-dirty approach to testing the hypothesis, which involved feeding bill information into an LLM and getting it to rate bills by importance.
Thus, he found that there were more impactful bills passed than he (and I) would have believed.

*** Why Is That?

I can think of a couple of reasons which may or may not have to do with the "Secret Congress" hypothesis.
I was quite skeptical of it because legislators in the majority party have an incentive to publicize the passing of /any/ legislation, since it makes their governance seem more effective.
There is also the fact that, as Arnav pointed out, there is no real political incentive for politicians to pass legislature if it won't get them re-elected, unless you believe in politicians acting out of the goodness of their hearts.
I suggest some other reasons for these findings:
+ *Interest Groups*: Election chances aren't a direct function of how helpful the legislation that a politician supports is to the general populace, or the world would be a better place.
  I'm quite surprised that this was not brought up by Yglesias as a reason why Congress might want to keep their activities secret from the public; after all, lobbyists will stay informed regardless, and the people perhaps shouldn't be.
+ *Housekeeping*: A lot of the bills that Arnav named were mostly terminating COVID-era spending or renewing existing processes, like the debt limit raise and FAA reauthorization.
  These could be considered important in some sense, but they are more about keeping things functional; it is about the disincentives of obstructionism, not the incentives for bipartisanship.
+ *Different Strokes*: While people like Arnav and I would not have heard much about disaster relief funding, I'm sure that people who were affected (or proximate to those affected) did.
  I suspect that people take disaster relief as a given; when FEMA got cut recently, it was definitely in the news.

In any case, if we take Congress to operate in secrecy, I would think that interest groups would be the biggest reason why.
More than enabling secrecy, they incentivize it in many case so that legislators are not held accountable.
I found [[https://archive.org/details/gilens_and_page_2014_-testing_theories_of_american_politics.doc/page/n5/mode/2up][this]] interesting study that looks at the quantifiable impacts of interest groups against the will of the citizenry, and though there are clear flaws (the analysis is rather rough and it is hard to draw particular conclusions), I think it is uncontroversial to say that interest groups have an outsized impact on the legislative process.

*** Closing Thoughts

I thought this was a pretty cool idea that was thoughtfully
@@html:{{< sidenote "executed" >}}Except for the art. Japanese art has lots of ninjas, no need to generate an AI one!{{< /sidenote >}}@@.
I agree that it would be cool to find some way to track congressional productivity over time, and I would further suggest doing so by legislator.
When people talk about how productive legislators are, they focus on the number of bills rather than the impact of said bills.
While there's more to being a legislator than writing impactful legislation (because enacting change takes many forms), I think that it would be a useful method of evaluation.
I am, however, too lazy to make it happen.
