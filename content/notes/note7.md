Another edition of interesting things that I have encountered online.


## Music {#music}

[Adrian Janes Interviews Adrian Borland](https://pennyblackmusic.co.uk/Home/Details?Id=28579): To me, The Sound is the essential post-punk band.
_Jeopardy_ and _From the Lions Mouth_ are passionate and steely works that hit you in the face with their sincerity.
If there's one thing you'll read about The Sound, though, it's that they're underrated, which probably isn't true now but was back when they played.
Now, we have a wealth of insight into the workings of the band because Penny Black Music has released so many interviews of the people involved in it.
Adrian Janes, who was in the band that would become The Sound, interviews lead singer/guitarist Adrian Borland in this multi-part interview and it's really interesting to hear about the sort of struggles
he had in leading a band that was too successful to be a side gig but not as successful as it deserved to be.

[Something Changed: Pulp’s Different Class Revisited](https://thequietus.com/opinion-and-essays/anniversary/pulp-different-class-review/): I've been listening to a lot more Pulp over the past few months, so this wonderfully sober essay on Different Class came at the right time, or, I guess, precisely ten years early.
I will never live this album out but I understand it better now.


## Tales {#tales}

[the mirror-self](https://www.late-review.com/p/the-mirror-self): Not as adept as some of the other essays that Kate Wagner has written over the past year, but one of the most immediate.
It made me think about whom I am writing for, and I think that it is some reflection of myself.
My journal is ostensibly a record for my future self, and I do read back over it sometimes, but it doesn't feel like I'm reading something that was addressed to me.
Similarly, I'm supposed to be writing this blog for my future self and the randos who stumble across it but I haven't really internalized that.
I write with one part of my head and simultaneously edit with another part, so in that sense I am writing to the editor in me, but for whom is my editor editing?

[I'm Bringing the Class War to Nantucket](https://burialmagazine.neocities.org/imbringingtheclasswartonantucket): I still don't understand this but it is extremely funny.
It is clearly an insane caricature but also cuts very close to the bone, both of which are hallmarks of good satire.


## Politics {#politics}

[The 200-hour supervisor](https://sfstandard.com/2025/11/15/san-francisco-daniel-lurie-isabella-beya-alcaraz/): This is the strange story of how a pet store owner became an SF City Supervisor before being exposed for being a bad pet store owner.
It still makes no sense and there's probably a lot about the situation that we still do not know.

[Jasmine Crockett's Blue Chip Strategy](https://newsletter.tysonbrody.com/p/jasmine-crocketts-blue-chip-strategy): Talarico's funded by gambling interests, but Crockett's funnelling insane amounts of crypto money in the hype machine.
If you'd like her to consult for you, [you know where to look](https://theclapbackcollection.com/services/).

[Demon Sheep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_GXTqyd4OI): The greatest ad, political or otherwise, of all time.


## Random Things {#random-things}

[Chimerical Colors](https://dynomight.substack.com/p/colors): If you desensitize some of your cones by staring at a color field and activate the others, you can see colors that no physical object could possibly have.
You can see an impossibly deep blue or an incredibly pure shade of green.
This is the same principle behind the color olo, which is only seen by stimulating a specific type of cone cell with lasers.

[Eileen Ahn's Personal Site](https://www.eileenie.net/): What a cool website!
For those who don't despise frontend, the sky's the limit...
