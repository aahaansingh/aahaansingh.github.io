* Hello, I'm Aahaan.

I'm a fourth-year student at the University of Chicago studying Computer Science and Economics, currently based in the SF Bay Area.
What motivates me is a desire to methodically break down and understand things—which I do mean in a vague sense—particularly those related to my interests.
Said interests include music, history, writing /and/ stationary, cricket, and tech (with regard to serving people).

Currently, you can find me on [[https://github.com/aahaansingh][Github]] or [[https://www.linkedin.com/in/aahaan-singh/][LinkedIn]].
