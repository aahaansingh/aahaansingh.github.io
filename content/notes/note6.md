Taking required art courses, as marginalized as they are, is a privilege of the university.
The best class I have taken in college was a class offered by the creative writing department about making comics.
The second best was a class I just took, also by the creative writing department, on graphic design.
I suppose that the creative writing department is to the college what protists are to the tree of life.

I say "marginalized" because art feels like an aside in the University of Chicago.
On a meta level, most of the buildings that the university builds these days are ugly.
On a physical level, most art-related resources are located in the
{{< sidenote "Logan Center," >}}Which is nevertheless a great building, in terms of how it looks and what it contains.{{< /sidenote >}}
right on the edge of campus.
On an academic level, art course offerings are pretty thin and are often stuffed into three-hour slots once per weeks as opposed to two or three meetings per week for the same amount of time,
which has the effect of shortening class time because finding something to do for three hours continuously is hard.
What I've noticed in both of my art classes, though, is that students often come in apathetic and leave a lot more excited about whatever they were doing.
It was crazy to see the difference in effort people put in between the first and last projects.
Furthermore, between the Logan Center, the Rennaisance Society, the school's various ensembles, and clubs on campus, we aren't wanting for performances.
[Summer Breeze](https://uchicagomab.com/) might not be my thing, but I've voted for them to bring KATSEYE in this year, so who knows?

The graphic design course consisted of a bunch of projects, the last of which involved making three brochures about an object.
The object I chose was a pen cartridge, but I bit off more than I could chew.
I started from the position that I wasn't going to use any of the stylistic elements that characterize stationery advertisements: script fonts, ink splashes, parchment, etc.
I wanted to "modernize" the cartridge, whatever that meant.

Somehow, I ended up with these:

Clearly, this has nothing to do at all with pen cartridges, no matter what the text says.
My professor noted that the colors were not well thought out and that the use of ASCII made the whole thing feel digital rather than analogue.
Fixing all of this would have required ripping it up and starting over, which I didn't have time for, so I had to make do with surface-level changes:

I think that this is uglier than the rough draft, which was very coherent but the wrong design.
The final draft is sort of coherent and sort of the right design for the object.
It still does not entirely fulfill the brief but it does a better job before.
The lesson learnt is that you can't do whatever you want when designing around something.
You have to balance your artistic will with the visual language of what you're trying to convey.

This reliance on callbacks seemed regressive to me—how can graphic design be interesting when you're regurgitating old styles?
I asked my professor what innovation looks like in the discipline and she drew an analogy to music.
She noted that on _Getting Killed_ (an album that I can somewhat respect, if not {{< backlink "post3" "enjoy" >}}), Geese came up with a style that is innovative by the standards of
bands in their category.
I think that it's such a big deal right now because Indie Rock has otherwise stagnated.
Even this album, though, calls back to artists of the past: their indie forbears, but also Krautrock, The Velvet Underground, and funk.
Popular art has to deal in callbacks, and what's left is individual expression and what my professor called "the zeitgeist."
Graphic design, as it is commonly encountered and produced, is a highly functional artform and thus obeys the same logic.
I have not been exposed to "experimental" graphic design, though I'm sure it exists.
At that point, though, I wonder how distinct it is from other forms of art.

As a bonus, here's a poster I did for the previous project, which was to express, in some way, the passage of a week in time.
I measured it in terms of articles that I read on my RSS Reader.
Unlike the object project, I am unreservedly pleased with how it turned out.
