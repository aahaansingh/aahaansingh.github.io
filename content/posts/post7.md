My friend is not a fan of _La Campanella_.
Despite being among Liszt's best known works, he told me recently, it is not a particularly great piece of music, never mind the fact that the theme itself is Paganini's.
Back when I still played the piano (in elementary school), I would occasionally put on classical music before bed, usually Mozart or Mendelssohn or something.
I can't name a single thing Mendelssohn ever wrote, and I don't think that I could back then either, but I still remember a few pieces from prehistoric era of music listening.
_La Campanella_, which I discovered on a "hardest songs to play on the piano" listicle, was my favorite.
Listening to it again for the first time in years, though, I realized that really isn't very enjoyable to listen to.
It's an impressive piece from a technical standpoint and the theme is very catchy but it is also full of very abrupt tonal and textural switches that break its spell.
The different passages have very little to do with each other and are embellished beyond the point of reason.
I also expect that it's not quite representative of Liszt  because I don't think anybody serious would

him otherwise.

There was a big Blackpink [song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POe9SOEKotk) a while back, "Shut Down," that samples Paganini's _La Campanella_, specifically the first two bars of the theme.
I have very little interest in K-Pop but [TwoSet Violin](https://www.youtube.com/@twosetviolin), the Youtube channel, was a guilty pleasure of mine at the time, and they put out a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8X2Kv-ztr8) criticizing the song.
The gist of it is that Blackpink committed a grave sin by only looping half of the theme and that the theme itself was performed sloppily.
These are valid critiques.
It would have been nice if Eddy was not dressed up as
{{< sidenote "Paganini" >}}Well, dressed in a leather jacket and Party City wig while pretending to be Paganini.{{< /sidenote >}}
and delivering the whole speech in a terrible Italian accent, but life is about taking the good with the bad.

One would then expect TwoSet to be well-versed in the art of making beats out of classical loops, and there one would be wrong.
Their "[response](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klmvaVvv_0c&list=RDklmvaVvv_0c)" to Blackpink, using the same piece, was pretty bad, but it was obviously intended to piss off Blackpink fans so they had an excuse.
When they signed off from Youtube last year with [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jExn6TXxenM&list=PLq-Pj3G-56pAxqRa2m1EgMLHHlXdB8TLY&index=10) and five other songs, though, they did not even have the shield of parody to hide behind.
Aside from the obvious, it's funny that they opened their song with the _Chaconne_, the very definition of raising
{{< sidenote "expectations," >}}There was too much reverb on it to fool me, though!{{< /sidenote >}}
before the bathos of... everything else.
The biggest indictment I can give of it is that aside from the subject matter, nothing about the song tells me that it was made by musicians of their caliber.
It's not even worth listening to for how idiosyncratic it is because the way in which it fails is merely ordinary, as is the case of the "Shut Down."
The rest of the TwoSet set is similarly bad, so I was a bit sad to hear that those were the last videos that they were going to post to their channel.
They came back five months later, though, so they got to
{{< backlink "note4" "keep their cake and eat it, too." >}}

While the production value makes it clear that those songs were inspired by K-Pop (which makes the Blackpink song doubly bad), they are poor imitations of the real product.
K-Pop is very much ahead of the times compared to the US (and the rest of the world) in terms of how their music sounds, how their music videos look, and how they market their stars.
People don't love pop stars for their music alone, whether they be Korean or otherwise, but the K-Pop model of entertainment is a far broader and more ruthless vision than anything the American industry has dreamt up.
For one, even the illusion of creative control has been abolished.
Everybody knows that songs are spat out by the gaping maw of the K-Pop company, all spit-slick and transparently shallow, regurgitating the same words and stock set of images.
No matter—music is merely a part of the multimedia experience.
Indeed, it often seems like the dancing (which is generally well-executed) is the main attraction, with the songs as the accompaniment.
Buying merch, watching constantly-available stars talk about their lives, and attending obscenely expensive concerts—in sum, the experience of being a fan—are far more important than the object of the fandom.

What's more, even the process of becoming a K-Pop idol is heavily monetized.
Survival shows, which are like American Idol if it involved starving Koreans, are extremely common and have the bonus of hyping up a company's next launch.
This model made its way back to the US with _Dream Academy_, a collaboration between American and Korean corporations which lead to the formation of Katseye.
I have been informed that it is extremely boring.
Consequently, Katseye did not get big until over a year later, when they started releasing intentionally idiotic songs with the goal of drumming up attention.
This is a well-trodden path, but it did not have to be this way.

Cast your eyes towards
{{< sidenote "NCT," >}}Which stands for Neo Cultural Technology, an unusually apt description for what they are. They're actually a collection of related groups, but the distinctions between them are unclear to me so I refer to them as a unit.{{< /sidenote >}}
the platonic ideal of the K-Pop group.
Traditional pop is verse-chorus-verse, but [NCT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkKnp4SdE-w) sees songs as a series of one minute segments in order to maximize short-form video exposure and decaying attention spans.
They also want to look as cool as possible.
This is a very obvious set of premises for a K-Pop company to generate songs from, but they also have emergent properties.
With songs being a set of moments, every moment must be the climax, but the next moment must be even greater.
A twenty-second long high note must be followed by frantic karate-chopping.
Suggestive hot-sauce metaphors must give way to atrocious beat drops.
Furthermore, being cool means imitating cool Americans, so songs must contain random smatterings of English, be about girls or cars, and embody a sufficient level of SWAG.
This may read differently to their target audience, but to me it comes off as inadvertently hillarious.
The result is that NCT's works accelerate towards insanity, and the beauty is is in how logical and unintentional these aspects are.
Absurdity is rendered comprehensible.
Katseye is too self-aware to ever reach these heights, and must settle for the low art of ragebait.
As such, their music, like whatever Tommy Wiseau did after _The Room_, just sucks.

So we have the boringly bad, the intentionally terrible, and the sublimely awful.
I wish that it were possible to mass-produce the latter, but truly great works of bad art cannot be manufactured.
We must wait for them to arise from the strange areas beyond our cultural perspective.
