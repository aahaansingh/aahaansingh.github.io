I went to Indiana Dunes recently, along with fifty other people, as the last among my friends to do so.
The others went either last year or the year before, so I knew what to expect, but I somehow had trouble reconciling the concept of sand dunes with Indiana in the same way that I laughed at the billboards in Chicago advertising their beaches.
It's a case of taking what you can get, I suppose.

The club that organized this trip, the Outdoor Adventures Club, is headed by my supremely, obsessively organized friend, who bought a blanket pass for all of us on the South Shore Line.
I hadn't taken it before, because I do not find myself with a hankering to visit South Bend particularly

Remains of the route's glory days are hung in the figure of posters in the Harper Library, vibrant Art Noveau advertisements extolling the wonders of the various communities and natural attractions along the shore.
Nowadays it has a more somber mood, passing as it does through a depleted industrial corridor whose functions have long since been offshored, but beauty remains.
The homes are brick in Pullman, like the rest of the city, but Victorian in style, and the churches are reminiscent of the Pilsners to the northwest.
Unlike Pilsen, the streets are empty.

It is a similar story with downtown Gary, which houses numerous Neoclassical and Art Deco buildings but lies largely vacant.
Gary is a bit of a joke on campus, our local basket of deplorables in the same way that Oakland is the Bay's.
To be contemptuous towards something as abstract as a city, I think, is a bit
{{< sidenote "presumptuous." >}}I am calling myself presumptuous because this is exactly what I feel for Newark, and maybe San Jose.{{< /sidenote >}}
Gary is doing much better than [City West](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_West,_Indiana), formerly located near the beach, which attempted to build a "grand port" on Lake Michigan under a spurious interpretation of a Daniel Webster speech before burning to the ground sometime around 1840.

Walking along the road to the first dune, we passed by a trailer park.
They are a rarity where I come from, so it was strange to see what appeared to be large and expensive buses with names like "Tiffin Zephyr" and "Holiday Rambler Vacationer," rather than the small RVs that I imagined would have been there.
I wonder what attracts people to these motor homes.
I'm sure there are actual homes in the area cheaper than them, and there's not much point in camping if you're going to do it with a kitchen, toilet, and bedroom in tow.
Maybe it is a cultural quirk I do not understand—of the Midwest, or of the obscenely wealthy.

One inevitably thinks of the Sahara when dunes are mentioned, and indeed the mounds of sand in Indiana Dunes are, technically, dunes, but they are more of the vegetated, California coast variety.
They were also a total pain to hike up.
The slow slide of sand against the step makes ascending a dune a Sisyphean task, and I lack the fanatical conviction of someone who could have deserved such punishment.
I believe that my whining was justified.
Reaching the top of the first dune was worth it, though, because it was the perfect slope to slide back down on my butt, an experience so enjoyable that I did it _twice_.

The largest lakes where I come from are small enough to see across, so it is strange to be on the beach of a lake indistinguishable from the
{{< sidenote "sea." >}}Yes, Chicago is on the coast, but it's so built up and busy that even when you're on the lake, you aren't struck by the enormity of it.{{< /sidenote >}}
Incredibly enough, the sand was real sand, the waves were real waves, and the breeze was a real breeze.
The sun wasn't real hot but being fall in the Midwest, its absence was forgivable.
The Chicago skyline was just about visible from our point of view, but it was far enough away that the horizon obscured all but the tallest buildings.
It looked as though the city had flooded.

It did not seem as though there was much left for our group to do.
We had hiked up a dune, we had slid down a dune, and we had ended up on a chilly beach, which is generally as good as no beach.
However, this beach had extraordinarily flat stones, and, dropping my bag as if to anchor, I dug up a particularly round one.
The image and feeling of this stone simultaneously rushed from my eyes and fingers, through my nerves and into my brain, where they stimulated the rather oversized areas responsible for chucking stuff.

I am a prolific thrower of things, if not a particularly skilled one.
When I used to play tennis regularly, I would get more of a kick out of throwing tennis balls at the wall between points than from actually playing the game.
I was fascinated with spinning them—in the air, against the ground—which would annoy my sister to no end.
When the backyard got tiled, I taught myself to bowl, with upturned flower pots as makeshift stumps to aim at.
As much as I enjoy cricket as a sport, it is the act of bowling in and of itself, of manipulating the ball in the air, that brings me joy.
I despise batting.

Skipping stones is the purest expression of throwing.
Playing catch requires other people and throwing a ball as hard as you can requires you to be mindful of your surroundings, but on a large lake with a flat stone, there is nothing stopping you from ripping one along the surface as hard as you can.
Nothing but the elements, that is.
On this windy day, the water was choppy enough to turn stone-skipping into an unpredictable and difficult enterprise.
I strafed the beach for suitable rocks to skip and watched them struggle against the waves before inevitably being swallowed whole.
I wrote names on them using a chalky stone in the hope that, like the Ram Setu, they would stay afloat.
Based on my limited sample size, they skipped twice as much.
When I ran out of round stones, I started throwing long stones like tomahawks (try it—they're easier to skip that way _and_ you get to look like an even bigger idiot doing it).
Eventually, I was dragged along to the end of the beach by the current of bored people whom I was bound to.
This was disappointing, so I ate my turkey sandwich, which unfortunately was also disappointing.

We walked to the pavillion in the hopes of getting ice cream, only to find that the place had
{{< sidenote "closed for the season." >}}Every sane individual knows that ice cream is perennial.{{< /sidenote >}}
Nobody wanted to spend any money so ten minutes were spent shuffling awkwardly around the cafe-bar.
If somebody had bought something, everybody would have.
I whacked the sand out of my shoes, but then we had to walk back out of the park through the sand, so my shoes got sandy again, I complained again, and I whacked the sand out of my shoes again.

A couple of people were late to the station and missed the train back to Hyde Park.
I'm surprised that seven hours was not enough.
All I did was chuck stones, and all I got for it was a sore shoulder and sand everywhere.
On the bright side, I did break my record—25 skips!
